@comment TODO: nac29jan99 - a list of things to add in the next edit:
@comment 1. x-ref all ambiguous or implementation-defined features?
@comment 2. Describe the use of Auser Avariable AConstant A, etc.
@comment 3. words in miscellaneous section need a home.
@comment 4. search for TODO for other minor and major works required.
@comment 5. [rats] change all @var to @i in Forth source so that info
@comment    file looks decent.
@c          Not an improvement IMO - anton
@c          and anyway, this should be taken up
@c          with Karl Berry (the texinfo guy) - anton

@c  If they don't like the all-caps for @var Info output, all I can say is

@c  what it is, for the sake of consistency among manuals.

@comment .. would be useful to have a word that identified all deferred words
@comment should semantics stuff in intro be moved to another section

@c POSTPONE, COMPILE, [COMPILE], LITERAL should have their own section

This manual is for Gforth (version @value{VERSION}, @value{UPDATED}),
a fast and portable implementation of the Standard Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

@cindex Preface
This manual documents Gforth. Some introductory material is provided for
readers who are unfamiliar with Forth or who are migrating to Gforth
from other Forth compilers. However, this manual is primarily a
reference manual.

@chapter Goals of Gforth
@cindex goals of the Gforth project
The goal of the Gforth Project is to develop a standard model for
Standard Forth. This can be split into several subgoals:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Gforth should conform to the Forth Standard.
@item
It should be a model, i.e. it should define all the
implementation-dependent things.
@item
It should become standard, i.e. widely accepted and used. This goal
is the most difficult one.
@end itemize

To achieve these goals Gforth should be
@itemize @bullet
@item
Similar to previous models (fig-Forth, F83)
@item
Powerful. It should provide for all the things that are considered
necessary today and even some that are not yet considered necessary.
@item
Efficient. It should not get the reputation of being exceptionally
slow.
@item
Free.
@item
Available on many machines/easy to port.
@end itemize

Have we achieved these goals?

Gforth conforms to the Forth-94 (ANS Forth) and Forth-2012 standards.

We have changed some of the internal data structures (in particular,
the headers) over time, so Gforth does not provide the stability of
implementation details that we originally aimed for; they were too
constraining for a long-term project like Gforth.  However, we still
aim for a high level of stability.

Gforth is quite popular and is treated by some like a de-facto standard.

It has some similarities to and some differences from previous models.

It has powerful features, and the version 1.0 indicates that it can do
everything (and more) that we originally envisioned.  That does not
mean that we will stop development.

We certainly have achieved and exceeded our execution speed goals
(@pxref{Performance})@footnote{However, in 1998 the bar was raised
when the major commercial Forth vendors switched to native code
compilers.}.

Gforth is free and available on many platforms.

@cindex stability of Gforth

Programs that work on earlier versions of Gforth should also work on
newer versions.  However, there are some caveats:

Internal data structures (including the representation of code) of
Gforth may change between versions, unless they are documented.

Moreover, we only feel obliged to keep standard words (i.e., with
standard wordset names) and words documented as stable Gforth
extensions (with wordset name @code{gforth} or
@code{gforth-@i{<version>}}, @pxref{Notation}).  Other words may be
removed in newer releases.

In particular, you may find a word by using @code{locate} or otherwise
inspecting Gforth's source code.  You can see the wordset in a comment
right after the stack-effect comment.  E.g., in

@example
: execute-parsing ( ... addr u xt -- ... ) \ gforth
@end example

the wordset is @code{gforth}.

If there is no wordset for a word, it is an internal factor and may be
removed in a future version.  If the wordset is
@code{gforth-experimental}, @code{gforth-internal}, or
@code{gforth-obsolete}, the word may also be removed in a future
version.  In particular, @code{gforth-experimental} indicates that
this is a supported word that we do not consider stable yet;
@code{gforth-obsolete} indicates an intent to remove the word in the
next version; and @code{gforth-internal} (or no wordset) indicates

@section Invoking Gforth
@cindex invoking Gforth
@cindex running Gforth
@cindex command-line options
@cindex options on the command line
@cindex flags on the command line

Gforth is made up of two parts; an executable ``engine'' (named
@command{gforth} or @command{gforth-fast}) and an image file. To start it, you
will usually just say @code{gforth} -- this automatically loads the
default image file @file{gforth.fi}. In many other cases the default
Gforth image will be invoked like this:
@example
gforth [file | -e forth-code] ...
@end example
@noindent
This interprets the contents of the files and the Forth code in the order they
are given.

In addition to the @command{gforth} engine, there is also an engine
called @command{gforth-fast}, which is faster, but gives less
informative error messages (@pxref{Error messages}) and may catch some
errors (in particular, stack underflows and integer division errors)
later or not at all.  You should use it for debugged,
performance-critical programs.

Moreover, there is an engine called @command{gforth-itc}, which is
useful in some backwards-compatibility situations (@pxref{Direct or
Indirect Threaded?}).

In general, the command line looks like this:

@example
gforth[-fast] [engine options] [image options]
@end example

The engine options must come before the rest of the command
line. They are:

@c !! vollstaendig?
@table @code
@cindex -i, command-line option
@cindex --image-file, command-line option
@item --image-file @i{file}
@itemx -i @i{file}
Loads the Forth image @i{file} instead of the default
@file{gforth.fi} (@pxref{Image Files}).

@cindex --appl-image, command-line option
@item --appl-image @i{file}
Loads the image @i{file} and leaves all further command-line arguments
to the image (instead of processing them as engine options).  This is
useful for building executable application images on Unix, built with
@code{gforthmi --application ...}.

@cindex --no-0rc, command-line option
@item --no-0rc
Do not load @file{~/.config/gforthrc0} nor the file specified by
@code{GFORTH_ENV}.

@cindex --path, command-line option
@cindex -p, command-line option
@item --path @i{path}
@itemx -p @i{path}
Uses @i{path} for searching the image file and Forth source code files
instead of the default in the environment variable @code{GFORTHPATH} or
the path specified at installation time and the working directory
@code{.} (e.g., @file{/usr/local/share/gforth/0.2.0:.}). A path is given
as a list of directories, separated by @samp{:} (previous versions had
@samp{;} for other OSes, but since Cygwin now only accepts
@code{/cygdrive/<letter>}, and we dropped support for OS/2 and MS-DOS,
it is @samp{:} everywhere).

@cindex --dictionary-size, command-line option
@cindex -m, command-line option
@cindex @i{size} parameters for command-line options
@cindex size of the dictionary and the stacks
@item --dictionary-size @i{size}
@itemx -m @i{size}
Allocate @i{size} space for the Forth dictionary space instead of
using the default specified in the image (default: 8M). The
@i{size} specification for this and subsequent options consists of
an integer and a unit (e.g.,
@code{1G}). The unit can be one of @code{b} (bytes), @code{e} (element
size, in this case Cells), @code{k} (kilobytes), @code{M} (Megabytes),
@code{G} (Gigabytes), and @code{T} (Terabytes). If no unit is specified,
@code{e} is used.

@cindex --data-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -d, command-line option
@item --data-stack-size @i{size}
@itemx -d @i{size}
Allocate @i{size} space for the data stack instead of using the
default specified in the image (default: 16K).

@cindex --return-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -r, command-line option
@item --return-stack-size @i{size}
@itemx -r @i{size}
Allocate @i{size} space for the return stack instead of using the
default specified in the image (default: 15K).

@cindex --fp-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -f, command-line option
@item --fp-stack-size @i{size}
@itemx -f @i{size}
Allocate @i{size} space for the floating point stack instead of
using the default specified in the image (default: 15.5K). In this case
the unit specifier @code{e} refers to floating point numbers.

@cindex --locals-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -l, command-line option
@item --locals-stack-size @i{size}
@itemx -l @i{size}
Allocate @i{size} space for the locals stack instead of using the
default specified in the image (default: 14.5K).

@cindex --map_32bit, command-line option
@item --map_32bit
Allocate the dictionary and some other areas in the lower 2GB of the
address space, if possible.  The purpose of this option is debugging
convenience.

@cindex --vm-commit, command-line option
@cindex overcommit memory for dictionary and stacks
@cindex memory overcommit for dictionary and stacks
@item --vm-commit
Normally, Gforth tries to start up even if there is not enough virtual
memory for the dictionary and the stacks (using @code{MAP_NORESERVE}
on OSs that support it); so you can ask for a really big dictionary
and/or stacks, and as long as you don't use more virtual memory than
is available, everything will be fine (but if you use more, processes
get killed).  With this option you just use the default allocation
policy of the OS; for OSs that don't overcommit (e.g., Solaris), this
means that you cannot and should not ask for as big dictionary and
stacks, but once Gforth successfully starts up, out-of-memory won't
kill it.

@cindex -h, command-line option
@cindex --help, command-line option
@item --help
@itemx -h
Print a message about the command-line options

@cindex -v, command-line option
@cindex --version, command-line option
@item --version
@itemx -v
Print version and exit

@cindex --diag, command-line option
@cindex -D, command-line option
@item --diag
@item -D
Checks for and reports some performance problems.

@cindex --debug, command-line option
@item --debug
Print some information useful for debugging on startup.

@cindex --debug-mcheck, command-line option
@item --debug-mcheck
Try to find and report erroneous usage of @code{allocate},
@code{free}, and the C functions @code{malloc()}, @code{free()}, etc.

@cindex --offset-image, command-line option
@item --offset-image
Start the dictionary at a slightly different position than would be used
otherwise (useful for creating data-relocatable images,
@pxref{Data-Relocatable Image Files}).

@cindex --no-offset-im, command-line option
@item --no-offset-im
Start the dictionary at the normal position.

@cindex --clear-dictionary, command-line option
@item --clear-dictionary
Initialize all bytes in the dictionary to 0 before loading the image
(@pxref{Data-Relocatable Image Files}).

@cindex --die-on-signal, command-line-option
@item --die-on-signal [@i{number}]
Normally Gforth handles most signals (e.g., the user interrupt SIGINT,
or the segmentation violation SIGSEGV) by translating it into a Forth
@code{THROW}. With this option, Gforth exits if it receives such a
signal. This option is useful when the engine and/or the image might be
severely broken (such that it causes another signal before recovering
from the first); this option avoids endless loops in such cases.  The
optional number set the number of signals to be handled; only the last
one will cause Gforth to exit.

@cindex --ignore-async-signals, command-line-option
@item --ignore-async-signals
Ignore asynchronous signals (e.g., @code{SIGINT} generated with
@kbd{Ctrl-c}).

@end table

@subsection Code generation options

@table @code

@cindex --no-dynamic, command-line option
@cindex --dynamic, command-line option
@item --no-dynamic
@item --dynamic
Disable or enable dynamic superinstructions with replication
(@pxref{Dynamic Superinstructions}).  Default enabled.

@cindex --no-dynamic-image, command-line option
@item --no-dynamic-image
Disable dynamic native-code generation when loading the Gforth image,
but generate dynamic native code afterwards.  This option is useful
when debugging Gforth's code generator.

@cindex --no-super, command-line option
@item --no-super
Disable dynamic superinstructions, use just dynamic replication; this is
useful if you want to patch threaded code (@pxref{Dynamic
Superinstructions}).

@cindex --ss-number, command-line option
@item --ss-number=@var{N}
Use only the first @var{N} static superinstructions compiled into the
engine (default: use them all; note that only @code{gforth-fast} has
any).  This option is useful for measuring the performance impact of
static superinstructions.

@cindex --ss-min-..., command-line options
@item --ss-min-codesize
@item --ss-min-ls
@item --ss-min-lsu
@item --ss-min-nexts
Use specified metric for determining the cost of a primitive or static
superinstruction for static superinstruction selection.  @code{Codesize}
is the native code size of the primitive or static superinstruction,
@code{ls} is the number of loads and stores, @code{lsu} is the number of
loads, stores, and updates, and @code{nexts} is the number of dispatches
(not taking dynamic superinstructions into account), i.e. every
primitive or static superinstruction has cost 1. Default:
@code{codesize} if you use dynamic code generation, otherwise
@code{nexts}.

@cindex --ss-greedy, command-line option
@item --ss-greedy
This option is useful for measuring the performance impact of static
superinstructions.  By default, an optimal shortest-path algorithm is
used for selecting static superinstructions.  With @option{--ss-greedy}
this algorithm is modified to assume that anything after the static
superinstruction currently under consideration is not combined into
static superinstructions.  With @option{--ss-min-nexts} this produces
the same result as a greedy algorithm that always selects the longest
superinstruction available at the moment.  E.g., if there are
superinstructions AB and BCD, then for the sequence A B C D the optimal
algorithm will select A BCD and the greedy algorithm will select AB C D.

@cindex --opt-ip-updates, command-line option
@item --opt-ip-updates=@i{n}
Set the level of IP-update optimization (default: 31 (7+3*8)).  @i{n}
is computed as @i{n1}+8*@i{n2}.

@i{n1} indicates the use of IP-update optimization in straight-line
code: 0 means no IP-update optimization, 1 combines IP-update
optimizations of primitives without inline arguments, 2 also
eliminates the dead IP updates of @code{;s}, @code{execute-;s} and
@i{fast-throw}, >2 eliminates the IP updates in front of several
frequently-used primitives with inline arguments.

@i{n2} is the number of ip-updates that can replace a load in a
backwards or unconditional branch; for conditional forward branches
only @i{n2}/2 ip-updates replace a load (to avoid too many additional
updates in the fall-through path).

@cindex --code-block-size, command-line option
@item --code-block-size=@i{size}
Size of native-code blocks (default: 2M).  Gforth allocates as many
blocks of this size as necessary.

@cindex --print-metrics, command-line option
@item --print-metrics
On exit from Gforth: Print some metrics used during static
superinstruction selection: @code{code size} is the actual size of the
dynamically generated code.  @code{Metric codesize} is the sum of the
codesize metrics as seen by static superinstruction selection; there
is a difference from @code{code size}, because not all primitives and
static superinstructions are compiled into dynamically generated code,
and because of markers.  The other metrics correspond to the
@option{ss-min-...} options.  This option is useful for evaluating the
effects of the @option{--ss-...}  options.

@cindex --print-prims, command-line option
@item --print-prims
When exiting GforthL: Print the primitives with static usage counts.
E.g., one line might look like:

@example
?branch           1-1  0   21 1575   73 0x5573e4048c33 len= 4+ 25+ 3 send=0
@end example

The columns are, from left to right: name of the primitive,
stack-caching state transition (from a state with 1 stack item in a
register to the same state in the example), IP offset for this version
of the primitive (0 for most primitives, but, e.g., for @code{?branch}
there are also versions with 0-zero offset), index of the primitive,
index of the corresponding branch-to-IP variant (in case of a branch),
static number of occurrences of the primitive in the loaded/compiled
code, address of the code of the primitive (or @code{(nil)} if the
primitive is not relocatable), length of the parts of this code:
ip-update+main+dispatch, and whether the primitive ends a superblock
(i.e., an unconditional branch or the like).

@cindex --print-nonreloc, command-line option
@item --print-nonreloc
When starting Gforth: Print the non-relocatable primitives.

@cindex --print-sequences, command-line option
@item --print-sequences
When loading the image: For each superblock in the image, print the
sequence of primitives.

@cindex --tpa-noequiv, command-line option
@cindex --tpa-noautomaton, command-line option
@item --tpa-noautomaton
@item --tpa-noequiv
These options are about using an automaton for speeding up startup and
compilation, in particular the shortest-path algorithm used for
selecting static superinstructions and stack caching variants; tpa
stands for for ``tree-parsing automaton'' (although we only have
sequences, not trees).  In the @code{gforth} engine the default is to
use an automaton with state equivalence (state equivalence reduces the
number of states compared to having one state for every sequence
prefix), which is the fastest option and requires the least memory.

With static superinstructions the automaton does not work correctly,
so Gforth falls back to @code{--tpa-noautomaton} in that case unless
you ask for @code{--tpa-noequiv} (@code{gforth-fast} uses static
superinstructions and therefore @code{--tpa-noautomaton} by default).

@code{--tpa-noequiv} turns off state equivalence, which costs memory
and compiles a little slower than using an automaton.

@code{--tpa-noautomaton} turns off using the automaton.  This consumes
quite a bit more compile time, and should in theory use less memory
than using an automaton, but apparently there is a bug in Gforth, and
it consumes more memory.

The following shows the startup speed and memory consumption of Gforth
0.7.9_20240821 run with @code{gforth-fast -e bye} (plus the options
given in the table) on a Core-i5 6600K (Skylake):

@c for i in --ss-number=0 "--ss-number=0 --tpa-noequiv" "--ss-number=0 --tpa-noautomaton" "" --tpa-noequiv --tpa-noautomaton; do LC_NUMERIC=prog perf stat -e cycles:u -e instructions:u gforth-fast $i -e bye |& awk '/cycles|instructions/ {printf("%s ",$1)} END {print}'; done
@c for i in --ss-number=0 "--ss-number=0 --tpa-noequiv" "--ss-number=0 --tpa-noautomaton" "" --tpa-noequiv --tpa-noautomaton; do setarch -R /usr/bin/time -v gforth-fast $i -e "bye" |& grep "Maximum resident set size"; done

@example

23_309_239  43_534_167   9228   --ss-number=0
26_399_456  51_895_687  11316   --ss-number=0 --tpa-noequiv
40_427_672  93_709_354  10988   --ss-number=0 --tpa-noautomaton

@end example

@cindex --tpa-trace, command-line option
@item --tpa-trace
This option produces data about the number of states generated during
startup and compilation.


@end table

@subsection Image-specific options of @file{gforth.fi}

@cindex loading files at startup
@cindex executing code on startup
@cindex batch processing with Gforth
@cindex scripting with Gforth
@anchor{Scripting mode}
As explained above, the image-specific command-line arguments for the
default image @file{gforth.fi} consist of a sequence of filenames and
@code{-e @var{forth-code}} options that are interpreted in the
sequence in which they are given. The @code{-e @var{forth-code}} or
@code{--evaluate @var{forth-code}} option evaluates the Forth
code. This option takes only one argument; if you want to evaluate
more Forth words, you have to quote them or use @code{-e} several
times. To exit after processing the command line (instead of entering
interactive mode) append @code{-e bye} to the command line.  You can
also process the command-line arguments with a Forth program
(@pxref{OS command line arguments}).  If there is an uncaught
exception while processing image options, Gforth will exit with a
non-zero exit code.  This is how you run scripts in Gforth.

@cindex versions, invoking other versions of Gforth
If you have several versions of Gforth installed, @code{gforth} will
invoke the version that was installed last. @code{gforth-@i{<version>}}
invokes a specific version. If your environment contains the variable
@code{GFORTHPATH}, you may want to override it by using the
@code{--path} option.

On startup, before processing any of the image options, the user
initialization file is included, if it exists.  The user
initialization file is @file{~/.config/gforthrc0}, or, if the
environment variable @code{GFORTH_ENV} is set, it contains the name of
the user initialization file.  You can suppress loading this file with
by setting @code{GFORTH_ENV} to @code{off}, or with the option
@code{--no-0rc}.

After processing all the image options and just before printing the
boot message, the user initialization file @file{~/.config/gforthrc}
from your home directory is included, unless the option @code{--no-rc}
is given.

Warning levels can be set with

@table @code
@cindex -W, command-line option
@item -W
Turn off warnings

@cindex -Won, command-line option
@item -Won
Turn on warnings (level 1)

@cindex -Wall, command-line option
@item -Wall
Turn on beginner warnings (level 2)

@cindex -Wpedantic, command-line option
@item -Wpedantic
Turn on pedantic warnings (level 3)

@cindex -Werror, command-line option

@section Command-line editing
@cindex command-line editing

Gforth maintains a history file that records every line that you type to
the text interpreter. This file is preserved between sessions, and is
used to provide a command-line recall facility; if you type @kbd{Ctrl-P}
repeatedly you can recall successively older commands from this (or
previous) session(s). The full list of command-line editing facilities is:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-p} (``previous'') (or up-arrow) to recall successively older
lines from the history buffer.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-n} (``next'') (or down-arrow) to recall successively newer
lines from the history buffer.  If you moved to an older line earlier
and gave it to Gforth for text-interpretation, asking for the next
line as the first editing command gives you the next line after the
one you selected last time.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-f} (or right-arrow) to move the cursor right, non-destructively.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-b} (or left-arrow) to move the cursor left, non-destructively.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-h} (backspace) to delete the character to the left of the cursor,
closing up the line.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-k} to delete (``kill'') from the cursor to the end of the line.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-a} to move the cursor to the start of the line.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-e} to move the cursor to the end of the line.
@item
@key{RET} (@kbd{Ctrl-m}) or @key{LFD} (@kbd{Ctrl-j}) to submit the current
line.
@item
@key{TAB} to step through all possible full-word completions of the word
currently being typed.
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-d} on an empty line line to terminate Gforth (gracefully,
using @code{bye}). 
@item
@kbd{Ctrl-x} (or @code{Ctrl-d} on a non-empty line) to delete the
character under the cursor.
@end itemize

When editing, displayable characters are inserted to the left of the
cursor position; the line is always in ``insert'' (as opposed to
``overstrike'') mode.

@cindex history file
@cindex @file{.gforth-history}
On Unix systems, the history file is
@file{$HOME/.local/share/gforth/history} by default@footnote{i.e. it
is stored in the user's home directory.}. You can find out the name
and location of your history file using:

@example 
history-file type \ Unix-class systems

history-file type \ Other systems
history-dir  type
@end example

If you enter long definitions by hand, you can use a text editor to
paste them out of the history file into a Forth source file for reuse at
a later time.

Gforth never trims the size of the history file, so you should do this
periodically, if necessary.

@comment this is all defined in history.fs

@code{GFORTHHIST} -- (Unix systems only) specifies the path for the
history file @file{.gforth-history}. Default:
@code{$HOME/.local/share/gforth/history}.

@item
@cindex @code{GFORTHPATH} -- environment variable
@code{GFORTHPATH} -- specifies the path used when searching for the
gforth image file and for Forth source-code files (usually @samp{.}, the
current working directory).  Path separator is @samp{:}, a typical path
would be @file{/usr/local/share/gforth/1.0:.}.

@item
@cindex @code{LC_CTYPE} -- environment variable
@code{LC_CTYPE} -- If this variable contains ``UTF-8'' on Gforth
startup, Gforth uses the UTF-8 encoding for strings internally and
expects its input and produces its output in UTF-8 encoding, otherwise
the encoding is 8bit (@pxref{Xchars and Unicode}).  If this
environment variable is unset, Gforth looks in @code{LC_ALL}, and if
that is unset, in @code{LANG}.

@item
@cindex @code{GFORTHSYSTEMPREFIX} -- environment variable
@code{GFORTHSYSTEMPREFIX} -- specifies what to prepend to the argument

@cindex pipes, Gforth as part of

Gforth can be used in pipes created elsewhere (described in the
following).  It can also create pipes on its own (@pxref{Pipes}).

@cindex input from pipes
If you pipe into Gforth, your program should read with @code{read-file}
or @code{read-line} from @code{stdin} (@pxref{General files}).
@code{Key} does not recognize the end of input.  Words like
@code{accept} echo the input and are therefore usually not useful for
reading from a pipe.  You have to invoke the Forth program with an OS
command-line option, as you have no chance to use the Forth command line
(the text interpreter would try to interpret the pipe input).

@cindex output in pipes
You can output to a pipe with @code{type}, @code{emit}, @code{cr} etc.

@cindex silent exiting from Gforth
When you write to a pipe that has been closed at the other end, Gforth
receives a SIGPIPE signal (``pipe broken'').  Gforth translates this
into the exception @code{broken-pipe-error}.  If your application does
not catch that exception, the system catches it and exits, usually
silently (unless you were working on the Forth command line; then it
prints an error message and exits).  This is usually the desired
behaviour.

If you do not like this behaviour, you have to catch the exception
yourself, and react to it.

Here's an example of an invocation of Gforth that is usable in a pipe:

@example
gforth -e ": foo begin pad dup 10 stdin read-file throw dup while \
 type repeat ; foo bye"
@end example

This example just copies the input verbatim to the output.  A very
simple pipe containing this example looks like this:

@example
cat startup.fs |
gforth -e ": foo begin pad dup 80 stdin read-file throw dup while \
 type repeat ; foo bye"|
head
@end example

@cindex stderr and pipes
Pipes involving Gforth's @code{stderr} output do not work.

@node Startup speed,  , Gforth in pipes, Gforth Environment
@section Startup speed
@cindex Startup speed
@cindex speed, startup

If Gforth is used for CGI scripts or in shell scripts, its startup
speed may become a problem.  On a 3GHz Core 2 Duo E8400 under 64-bit
Linux 2.6.27.8 with libc-2.7, @code{gforth-fast -e bye} takes 13.1ms
user and 1.2ms system time (@code{gforth -e bye} is faster on startup
with about 3.4ms user time and 1.2ms system time, because it subsumes
some of the options discussed below).

If startup speed is a problem, you may consider the following ways to
improve it; or you may consider ways to reduce the number of startups
(for example, by using Fast-CGI).  Note that the first steps below
improve the startup time at the cost of run-time (including
compile-time), so whether they are profitable depends on the balance
of these times in your application.

An easy step that influences Gforth startup speed is the use of a
number of options that increase run-time, but decrease image-loading
time.

The first of these that you should try is @code{--ss-number=0
--ss-states=1} because this option buys relatively little run-time
speedup and costs quite a bit of time at startup.  @code{gforth-fast
--ss-number=0 --ss-states=1 -e bye} takes about 2.8ms user and 1.5ms
system time.

The next option is @code{--no-dynamic} which has a substantial impact
on run-time (about a factor of 2-4 on several platforms), but still
makes startup speed a little faster: @code{gforth-fast --ss-number=0
--ss-states=1 --no-dynamic -e bye} consumes about 2.6ms user and 1.2ms
system time.

@c did not work when I checked it on 2024-08-24
@c The next step to improve startup speed is to use a data-relocatable
@c image (@pxref{Data-Relocatable Image Files}).  This avoids the
@c relocation cost for the code in the image (but not for the data).
@c Note that the image is then specific to the particular binary you are
@c using (i.e., whether it is @code{gforth}, @code{gforth-fast}, and even
@c the particular build).  You create the data-relocatable image that
@c works with @code{./gforth-fast} with @code{GFORTHD="./gforth-fast
@c --no-dynamic" gforthmi gforthdr.fi} (the @code{--no-dynamic} is
@c required here or the image will not work).  And you run it with
@c @code{gforth-fast -i gforthdr.fi ... -e bye} (the flags discussed
@c above don't matter here, because they only come into play on
@c relocatable code).  @code{gforth-fast -i gforthdr.fi -e bye} takes
@c about 1.1ms user and 1.2ms system time.
@c 
@c One step further is to avoid all relocation cost and part of the
@c copy-on-write cost through using a non-relocatable image
@c (@pxref{Non-Relocatable Image Files}).  However, this has the
@c disadvantage that it does not work on operating systems with address
@c space randomization (the default in, e.g., Linux nowadays), or if the
@c dictionary moves for any other reason (e.g., because of a change of
@c the OS kernel or an updated library), so we cannot really recommend
@c it.  You create a non-relocatable image with @code{gforth-fast
@c --no-dynamic -e "savesystem gforthnr.fi bye"} (the @code{--no-dynamic}
@c is required here, too).  And you run it with @code{gforth-fast -i
@c gforthnr.fi ... -e bye} (again the flags discussed above don't
@c matter).  @code{gforth-fast -i gforthdr.fi -e bye} takes
@c about 0.9ms user and 0.9ms system time.

If the script you want to execute contains a significant amount of
code, it may be profitable to compile it into the image to avoid the
cost of compiling it at startup time.

The difference of this chapter from the Introduction
(@pxref{Introduction}) is that this tutorial is more fast-paced, should
be used while sitting in front of a computer, and covers much more
material, but does not explain how the Forth system works.

This tutorial can be used with any Standard-compliant Forth; any
Gforth-specific features are marked as such and you can skip them if
you work with another Forth.  This tutorial does not explain all
features of Forth, just enough to get you started and give you some
ideas about the facilities available in Forth.  Read the rest of the
manual when you are through this.

The intended way to use this tutorial is that you work through it while
sitting in front of the console, take a look at the examples and predict
what they will do, then try them out; if the outcome is not as expected,
find out why (e.g., by trying out variations of the example), so you
understand what's going on.  There are also some assignments that you
should solve.

This tutorial assumes that you have programmed before and know what,
e.g., a loop is.

@section Starting Gforth
@cindex starting Gforth tutorial
You can start Gforth by typing its name:

@example
gforth
@end example

That puts you into interactive mode; you can leave Gforth by typing
@code{bye}.  While in Gforth, you can edit the command line and access
the command line history with cursor keys, similar to bash.


@node Syntax Tutorial, Crash Course Tutorial, Starting Gforth Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Syntax
@cindex syntax tutorial

A @dfn{word} is a sequence of arbitrary characters (except white
space).  Words are separated by white space.  E.g., each of the
following lines contains exactly one word:

@example
word
!@@#$%^&*()
1234567890
5!a
@end example

A frequent beginner's error is to leave out necessary white space,
resulting in an error like @samp{Undefined word}; so if you see such an
error, check if you have put spaces wherever necessary.

@example
." hello, world" \ correct
."hello, world"  \ gives an "Undefined word" error
@end example

Gforth and most other Forth systems ignore differences in case (they are
case-insensitive), i.e., @samp{word} is the same as @samp{Word}.  If
your system is case-sensitive, you may have to type all the examples
given here in upper case.


@node Crash Course Tutorial, Stack Tutorial, Syntax Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Crash Course

Forth does not prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot.  Let's
try a few ways to crash Gforth:

@example
0 0 !
here execute
' catch >body 20 erase abort
' (quit1) >body 20 erase
@end example

The last two examples are guaranteed to destroy important parts of
Gforth (and most other systems), so you better leave Gforth afterwards
(if it has not finished by itself).  On some systems you may have to
kill gforth from outside (e.g., in Unix with @code{kill}).

You will find out later what these lines do and then you will get an
idea why they produce crashes.

Now that you know how to produce crashes (and that there's not much to
them), let's learn how to produce meaningful programs.


@node Stack Tutorial, Arithmetics Tutorial, Crash Course Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Stack
@cindex stack tutorial

The most obvious feature of Forth is the stack.  When you type in a
number, it is pushed on the stack.  You can display the contents of the
stack with @code{.s}.

@example
1 2 .s
3 .s
@end example

@code{.s} displays the top-of-stack to the right, i.e., the numbers
appear in @code{.s} output as they appeared in the input.

You can print the top element of the stack with @code{.}.

@example
1 2 3 . . .
@end example

In general, words consume their stack arguments (@code{.s} is an
exception).

@quotation Assignment
What does the stack contain after @code{5 6 7 .}?
@end quotation


@node Arithmetics Tutorial, Stack Manipulation Tutorial, Stack Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Arithmetics
@cindex arithmetics tutorial

The words @code{+}, @code{-}, @code{*}, @code{/}, and @code{mod} always
operate on the top two stack items:

@example
2 2 .s
+ .s
.
2 1 - .
7 3 mod .
@end example

The operands of @code{-}, @code{/}, and @code{mod} are in the same order
as in the corresponding infix expression (this is generally the case in
Forth).

Parentheses are superfluous (and not available), because the order of
the words unambiguously determines the order of evaluation and the
operands:

@example
3 4 + 5 * .
3 4 5 * + .
@end example

@quotation Assignment
What are the infix expressions corresponding to the Forth code above?
Write @code{6-7*8+9} in Forth notation@footnote{This notation is also
known as Postfix or RPN (Reverse Polish Notation).}.
@end quotation

To change the sign, use @code{negate}:

@example
2 negate .
@end example

@quotation Assignment
Convert -(-3)*4-5 to Forth.
@end quotation

@code{/mod} performs both @code{/} and @code{mod}.

@example
7 3 /mod . .
@end example

@node Stack Manipulation Tutorial, Using files for Forth code Tutorial, Arithmetics Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Stack Manipulation
@cindex stack manipulation tutorial

Stack manipulation words rearrange the data on the stack.

@example
1 .s drop .s
1 .s dup .s drop drop .s
1 2 .s over .s drop drop drop
1 2 .s swap .s drop drop
1 2 3 .s rot .s drop drop drop
@end example

These are the most important stack manipulation words.  There are also
variants that manipulate twice as many stack items:

@example
1 2 3 4 .s 2swap .s 2drop 2drop
@end example

Two more stack manipulation words are:

@example
1 2 .s nip .s drop
1 2 .s tuck .s 2drop drop
@end example

@quotation Assignment
Replace @code{nip} and @code{tuck} with combinations of other stack

@node Using files for Forth code Tutorial, Comments Tutorial, Stack Manipulation Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Using files for Forth code
@cindex loading Forth code, tutorial
@cindex files containing Forth code, tutorial

While working at the Forth command line is convenient for one-line
examples and short one-off code, you probably want to store your source
code in files for convenient editing and persistence.  You can use your
favourite editor (Gforth includes Emacs support, @pxref{Emacs and
Gforth}) to create @var{file.fs} and use

@example
s" @var{file.fs}" included
@end example

to load it into your Forth system.  The file name extension I use for
Forth files is @samp{.fs}.

You can easily start Gforth with some files loaded like this:

@example
gforth @var{file1.fs} @var{file2.fs}
@end example

If an error occurs during loading these files, Gforth terminates,
whereas an error during @code{INCLUDED} within Gforth usually gives you
a Gforth command line.  Starting the Forth system every time gives you a
clean start every time, without interference from the results of earlier
tries.

I often put all the tests in a file, then load the code and run the
tests with

@example
gforth @var{code.fs} @var{tests.fs} -e bye
@end example

(often by performing this command with @kbd{C-x C-e} in Emacs).  The
@code{-e bye} ensures that Gforth terminates afterwards so that I can
restart this command without ado.

The advantage of this approach is that the tests can be repeated easily
every time the program is changed, making it easy to catch bugs
introduced by the change.

Reference: @ref{Forth source files}.


@node Comments Tutorial, Colon Definitions Tutorial, Using files for Forth code Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Comments
@cindex comments tutorial

@example
\ That's a comment; it ends at the end of the line
( Another comment; it ends here: )  .s
@end example

@code{\} and @code{(} are ordinary Forth words and therefore have to be
separated with white space from the following text.

@example
\This gives an "Undefined word" error
@end example

The first @code{)} ends a comment started with @code{(}, so you cannot
nest @code{(}-comments; and you cannot comment out text containing a
@code{)} with @code{( ... )}@footnote{therefore it's a good idea to
avoid @code{)} in word names.}.

I use @code{\}-comments for descriptive text and for commenting out code
of one or more line; I use @code{(}-comments for describing the stack
effect, the stack contents, or for commenting out sub-line pieces of
code.

The Emacs mode @file{gforth.el} (@pxref{Emacs and Gforth}) supports
these uses by commenting out a region with @kbd{C-x \}, uncommenting a
region with @kbd{C-u C-x \}, and filling a @code{\}-commented region
with @kbd{M-q}.

are similar to procedures and functions in other programming languages.

@code{:} starts the colon definition; its name is @code{squared}.  The
following comment describes its stack effect.  The words @code{dup *}
are not executed, but compiled into the definition.  @code{;} ends the
colon definition.

The newly-defined word can be used like any other word, including using
it in other definitions:

@example
: cubed ( n -- n^3 )
   dup squared * ;
-5 cubed .

   squared squared ;
3 fourth-power .

You can decompile colon definitions with @code{see}:

@end example

In Gforth @code{see} shows you a reconstruction of the source code from
the executable code.  Informations that were present in the source, but
not in the executable code, are lost (e.g., comments).

You can also decompile the predefined words:

@example
see .
see +
@end example


@node Stack-Effect Comments Tutorial, Types Tutorial, Decompilation Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Stack-Effect Comments
@cindex stack-effect comments, tutorial
@cindex --, tutorial
By convention the comment after the name of a definition describes the
stack effect: The part in front of the @samp{--} describes the state of
the stack before the execution of the definition, i.e., the parameters
that are passed into the colon definition; the part behind the @samp{--}
is the state of the stack after the execution of the definition, i.e.,
the results of the definition.  The stack comment only shows the top
stack items that the definition accesses and/or changes.

You should put a correct stack effect on every definition, even if it is
just @code{( -- )}.  You should also add some descriptive comment to
more complicated words (I usually do this in the lines following
@code{:}).  If you don't do this, your code becomes unreadable (because
you have to work through every definition before you can understand
any).

@quotation Assignment
The stack effect of @code{swap} can be written like this: @code{x1 x2 --
x2 x1}.  Describe the stack effect of @code{-}, @code{drop}, @code{dup},
@code{over}, @code{rot}, @code{nip}, and @code{tuck}.  Hint: When you
are done, you can compare your stack effects to those in this manual
(@pxref{Word Index}).
@end quotation

Sometimes programmers put comments at various places in colon
definitions that describe the contents of the stack at that place (stack
comments); i.e., they are like the first part of a stack-effect
comment. E.g.,

@example
: cubed ( n -- n^3 )
   dup squared  ( n n^2 ) * ;
@end example

In this case the stack comment is pretty superfluous, because the word
is simple enough.  If you think it would be a good idea to add such a
comment to increase readability, you should also consider factoring the
word into several simpler words (@pxref{Factoring Tutorial,,
Factoring}), which typically eliminates the need for the stack comment;
however, if you decide not to refactor it, then having such a comment is
better than not having it.

The names of the stack items in stack-effect and stack comments in the
standard, in this manual, and in many programs specify the type through
a type prefix, similar to Fortran and Hungarian notation.  The most
frequent prefixes are:

@table @code
@item n
signed integer
@item u
unsigned integer
@item c
character
@item f
Boolean flags, i.e. @code{false} or @code{true}.
@item a-addr,a-
Cell-aligned address
@item c-addr,c-
Char-aligned address (note that a Char may have two bytes in Windows NT)
@item xt
Execution token, same size as Cell
@item w,x
Cell, can contain an integer or an address.  It usually takes 32, 64 or
16 bits (depending on your platform and Forth system). A cell is more
commonly known as machine word, but the term @emph{word} already means
something different in Forth.
@item d
signed double-cell integer
@item ud
unsigned double-cell integer
@item r
Float (on the FP stack)
@end table

You can find a more complete list in @ref{Notation}.

@quotation Assignment
Write stack-effect comments for all definitions you have written up to
now.
@end quotation


@node Types Tutorial, Factoring Tutorial, Stack-Effect Comments Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Types
@cindex types tutorial

In Forth the names of the operations are not overloaded; so similar
operations on different types need different names; e.g., @code{+} adds
integers, and you have to use @code{f+} to add floating-point numbers.
The following prefixes are often used for related operations on
different types:

@table @code
@item (none)
signed integer
@item u
unsigned integer
@item c
character
@item d
signed double-cell integer
@item ud, du
unsigned double-cell integer
@item 2
two cells (not-necessarily double-cell numbers)
@item m, um
mixed single-cell and double-cell operations
@item f
floating-point (note that in stack comments @samp{f} represents flags,
and @samp{r} represents FP numbers; also, you need to include the
exponent part in literal FP numbers, @pxref{Floating Point Tutorial}).
@end table

If there are no differences between the signed and the unsigned variant
(e.g., for @code{+}), there is only the prefix-less variant.

Forth does not perform type checking, neither at compile time, nor at
run time.  If you use the wrong operation, the data are interpreted
incorrectly:

@example
-1 u.
@end example

If you have only experience with type-checked languages until now, and
have heard how important type-checking is, don't panic!  In my
experience (and that of other Forthers), type errors in Forth code are
usually easy to find (once you get used to it), the increased vigilance
of the programmer tends to catch some harder errors in addition to most
type errors, and you never have to work around the type system, so in
most situations the lack of type-checking seems to be a win (projects to
add type checking to Forth have not caught on).


@node Factoring Tutorial, Designing the stack effect Tutorial, Types Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Factoring
@cindex factoring tutorial

If you try to write longer definitions, you will soon find it hard to
keep track of the stack contents.  Therefore, good Forth programmers
tend to write only short definitions (e.g., three lines).  The art of
finding meaningful short definitions is known as factoring (as in
factoring polynomials).

Well-factored programs offer additional advantages: smaller, more
general words, are easier to test and debug and can be reused more and
better than larger, specialized words.

So, if you run into difficulties with stack management, when writing
code, try to define meaningful factors for the word, and define the word
in terms of those.  Even if a factor contains only two words, it is
often helpful.

Good factoring is not easy, and it takes some practice to get the knack
for it; but even experienced Forth programmers often don't find the
right solution right away, but only when rewriting the program.  So, if
you don't come up with a good solution immediately, keep trying, don't
despair.

@c example !!


@node Designing the stack effect Tutorial, Local Variables Tutorial, Factoring Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Designing the stack effect
@cindex Stack effect design, tutorial
@cindex design of stack effects, tutorial

In other languages you can use an arbitrary order of parameters for a
function; and since there is only one result, you don't have to deal with
the order of results, either.

In Forth (and other stack-based languages, e.g., PostScript) the
parameter and result order of a definition is important and should be
designed well.  The general guideline is to design the stack effect such
that the word is simple to use in most cases, even if that complicates
the implementation of the word.  Some concrete rules are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Words consume all of their parameters (e.g., @code{.}).

@item
If there is a convention on the order of parameters (e.g., from
mathematics or another programming language), stick with it (e.g.,
@code{-}).

@item
If one parameter usually requires only a short computation (e.g., it is
a constant), pass it on the top of the stack.  Conversely, parameters
that usually require a long sequence of code to compute should be passed
as the bottom (i.e., first) parameter.  This makes the code easier to
read, because the reader does not need to keep track of the bottom item
through a long sequence of code (or, alternatively, through stack
manipulations). E.g., @code{!} (store, @pxref{Memory}) expects the
address on top of the stack because it is usually simpler to compute
than the stored value (often the address is just a variable).

@item
Similarly, results that are usually consumed quickly should be returned
on the top of stack, whereas a result that is often used in long
computations should be passed as bottom result.  E.g., the file words
like @code{open-file} return the error code on the top of stack, because
it is usually consumed quickly by @code{throw}; moreover, the error code
has to be checked before doing anything with the other results.

@end itemize

These rules are just general guidelines, don't lose sight of the overall
goal to make the words easy to use.  E.g., if the convention rule
conflicts with the computation-length rule, you might decide in favour
of the convention if the word will be used rarely, and in favour of the
computation-length rule if the word will be used frequently (because
with frequent use the cost of breaking the computation-length rule would
be quite high, and frequent use makes it easier to remember an
unconventional order).

@c example !! structure package


@node Local Variables Tutorial, Conditional execution Tutorial, Designing the stack effect Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Local Variables
@cindex local variables, tutorial

You can define local variables (@emph{locals}) in a colon definition:

@example
: swap @{ a b -- b a @}
  b a ;
1 2 swap .s 2drop
@end example

(If your Forth system does not support this syntax, include
@file{compat/anslocal.fs} first).

In this example @code{@{ a b -- b a @}} is the locals definition; it
takes two cells from the stack, puts the top of stack in @code{b} and
the next stack element in @code{a}.  @code{--} starts a comment ending
with @code{@}}.  After the locals definition, using the name of the
local will push its value on the stack.  You can omit the comment
part (@code{-- b a}):

@example
: swap ( x1 x2 -- x2 x1 )
  @{ a b @} b a ;
@end example

In Gforth you can have several locals definitions, anywhere in a colon
definition; in contrast, in a standard program you can have only one
locals definition per colon definition, and that locals definition must
be outside any control structure.

With locals you can write slightly longer definitions without running
into stack trouble.  However, I recommend trying to write colon
definitions without locals for exercise purposes to help you gain the

@section Conditional execution
@cindex conditionals, tutorial
@cindex if, tutorial

In Forth you can use control structures only inside colon definitions.
An @code{if}-structure looks like this:

@example
: abs ( n1 -- +n2 )
    dup 0 < if
        negate
    endif ;
5 abs .
-5 abs .
@end example

@code{if} takes a flag from the stack.  If the flag is non-zero (true),
the following code is performed, otherwise execution continues after the
@code{endif} (or @code{else}).  @code{<} compares the top two stack
elements and produces a flag:

@example
1 2 < .
2 1 < .
1 1 < .
@end example

Actually the standard name for @code{endif} is @code{then}.  This
tutorial presents the examples using @code{endif}, because this is often
less confusing for people familiar with other programming languages
where @code{then} has a different meaning.  If your system does not have
@code{endif}, define it with

@example
: endif postpone then ; immediate
@end example

You can optionally use an @code{else}-part:

@example
: min ( n1 n2 -- n )
  2dup < if
    drop
  else
    nip
  endif ;
2 3 min .
3 2 min .
@end example

@node Flags and Comparisons Tutorial, General Loops Tutorial, Conditional execution Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Flags and Comparisons
@cindex flags tutorial
@cindex comparison tutorial

In a false-flag all bits are clear (0 when interpreted as integer).  In
a canonical true-flag all bits are set (-1 as a twos-complement signed
integer); in many contexts (e.g., @code{if}) any non-zero value is
treated as true flag.

@example
false .
true .
true hex u. decimal
@end example

Comparison words produce canonical flags:

@example
1 1 = .
1 0= .
0 1 < .
0 0 < .
-1 1 u< . \ type error, u< interprets -1 as large unsigned number
-1 1 < .
@end example

Gforth supports all combinations of the prefixes @code{0 u d d0 du f f0}
(or none) and the comparisons @code{= <> < > <= >=}.  Only a part of
these combinations are standard (for details see the standard,
@ref{Numeric comparison}, @ref{Floating Point} or @ref{Word Index}).

You can use @code{and or xor invert} as operations on canonical flags.
Actually they are bitwise operations:

@example
1 2 and .
1 2 or .
1 3 xor .
1 invert .
@end example

You can convert a zero/non-zero flag into a canonical flag with
@code{0<>} (and complement it on the way with @code{0=}; indeed, it is
more common to use @code{0=} instead of @code{invert} for canonical
flags).

@example
1 0= .
1 0<> .
@end example

While you can use @code{if} without @code{0<>} to test for
zero/non-zero, you sometimes need to use @code{0<>} when combining
zero/non-zero values with @code{and or xor} because of their bitwise
nature.  The simplest, least error-prone, and probably clearest way is
to use @code{0<>} in all these cases, but in some cases you can use
fewer @code{0<>}s.  Here are some stack effects, where @i{fc}
represents a canonical flag, and @i{fz} represents zero/non-zero
(every @i{fc} also works as @i{fz}):

@example
or  ( fz1 fz2 -- fz3 )
and ( fz1 fc  -- fz2 )
and ( fc  fz1 -- fz2 )
@end example

So, if you see code like this:

@example
( n1 n2 ) 0<> and if
@end example

This tests whether n1 and n2 are non-zero and if yes, performs the
code after @code{if}; it treats n1 as zero/non-zero and uses @code{0<>} to
convert n2 into a canonical flag; the @code{and} then produces an fz,
which is consumed by the @code{if}.

You can use the all-bits-set feature of canonical flags and the bitwise
operation of the Boolean operations to avoid @code{if}s:

@example
: foo ( n1 -- n2 )
  0= if
    14
  else
    0
  endif ;
0 foo .
1 foo .

: foo ( n1 -- n2 )
  0= 14 and ;
0 foo .
1 foo .
@end example

@node General Loops Tutorial, Counted loops Tutorial, Flags and Comparisons Tutorial, Tutorial
@section General Loops
@cindex loops, indefinite, tutorial

The endless loop is the most simple one:

@example
: endless ( -- )
  0 begin
    dup . 1+
  again ;
endless
@end example

Terminate this loop by pressing @kbd{Ctrl-C} (in Gforth).  @code{begin}
does nothing at run-time, @code{again} jumps back to @code{begin}.

A loop with one exit at any place looks like this:

@example
: log2 ( +n1 -- n2 )
\ logarithmus dualis of n1>0, rounded down to the next integer
  assert( dup 0> )
  2/ 0 begin
    over 0> while
      1+ swap 2/ swap
  repeat
  nip ;
7 log2 .
8 log2 .
@end example

At run-time @code{while} consumes a flag; if it is 0, execution
continues behind the @code{repeat}; if the flag is non-zero, execution
continues behind the @code{while}.  @code{Repeat} jumps back to
@code{begin}, just like @code{again}.

In Forth there are a number of combinations/abbreviations, like
@code{1+}.  However, @code{2/} is not one of them; it shifts its
argument right by one bit (arithmetic shift right), and viewed as
division that always rounds towards negative infinity (floored
division), like Gforth's @code{/} (since Gforth 0.7), but unlike
@code{/} in many other Forth systems.

@example
-5 2 / . \ -2 or -3
-5 2/ .  \ -3
@end example

@code{assert(} is no standard word, but you can get it on systems other
than Gforth by including @file{compat/assert.fs}.  You can see what it
does by trying

@example
0 log2 .
@end example

Here's a loop with an exit at the end:

@example
: log2 ( +n1 -- n2 )
\ logarithmus dualis of n1>0, rounded down to the next integer
  assert( dup 0 > )
  -1 begin
    1+ swap 2/ swap
    over 0 <=
  until
  nip ;
@end example

@code{Until} consumes a flag; if it is zero, execution continues at
the @code{begin}, otherwise after the @code{until}.

@code{U+do} (from @file{compat/loops.fs}, if your Forth system doesn't

performs the code between @code{u+do} and @code{loop} for @code{u3-u4}
times (or not at all, if @code{u3-u4<0}).

You can see the stack effect design rules at work in the stack effect of
the loop start words: Since the start value of the loop is more
frequently constant than the end value, the start value is passed on
the top-of-stack.

You can access the counter of a counted loop with @code{i}:

@example
: fac ( u -- u! )

@node Return Stack Tutorial, Memory Tutorial, Leaving definitions or loops Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Return Stack
@cindex return stack tutorial

In addition to the data stack Forth also has a second stack, the return
stack; most Forth systems store the return addresses of procedure calls
there (thus its name).  Programmers can also use this stack:

@example
: foo ( n1 n2 -- )
 .s
 >r .s
 r@@ .
 >r .s
 r@@ .
 r> .
 r@@ .
 r> . ;
1 2 foo
@end example

@code{>r} takes an element from the data stack and pushes it onto the
return stack; conversely, @code{r>} moves an element from the return to
the data stack; @code{r@@} pushes a copy of the top of the return stack
on the data stack.

Forth programmers usually use the return stack for storing data
temporarily, if using the data stack alone would be too complex, and
factoring and locals are not an option:

@example
: 2swap ( x1 x2 x3 x4 -- x3 x4 x1 x2 )
 rot >r rot r> ;
@end example

The return address of the definition and the loop control parameters of
counted loops usually reside on the return stack, so you have to take
all items, that you have pushed on the return stack in a colon
definition or counted loop, from the return stack before the definition
or loop ends.  You cannot access items that you pushed on the return
stack outside some definition or loop within the definition of loop.

If you miscount the return stack items, this usually ends in a crash:

@example
: crash ( n -- )
  >r ;
5 crash
@end example

You cannot mix using locals and using the return stack (according to the
standard; Gforth has no problem).  However, they solve the same
problems, so this shouldn't be an issue.

@node Memory Tutorial, Characters and Strings Tutorial, Return Stack Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Memory
@cindex memory access/allocation tutorial

You can create a global variable @code{v} with

@example
variable v ( -- addr )
@end example

@code{v} pushes the address of a cell in memory on the stack.  This
cell was reserved by @code{variable}.  You can use @code{!} (store) to
store values from the stack into this cell and @code{@@} (fetch) to
load the value from memory onto the stack:

@example
v .
5 v ! .s
v @@ .
@end example

You can see a raw dump of memory with @code{dump}:

@example
v 1 cells .s dump
@end example

@code{Cells ( n1 -- n2 )} gives you the number of bytes (or, more
generally, address units (aus)) that @code{n1 cells} occupy.  You can
also reserve more memory:

@example
create v2 20 cells allot
v2 20 cells dump
@end example

creates a variable-like word @code{v2} and reserves 20 uninitialized
cells; the address pushed by @code{v2} points to the start of these 20
cells (@pxref{CREATE}).  You can use address arithmetic to access
these cells:

@example
3 v2 5 cells + !
v2 20 cells dump
@end example

You can reserve and initialize memory with @code{,}:

@example
create v3
  5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ,
v3 @@ .
v3 cell+ @@ .
v3 2 cells + @@ .
v3 5 cells dump
@end example

@quotation Assignment
Write a definition @code{vsum ( addr u -- n )} that computes the sum of
@code{u} cells, with the first of these cells at @code{addr}, the next
one at @code{addr cell+} etc.
@end quotation

The difference between @code{variable} and @code{create} is that
@code{variable} allots a cell, and that you cannot allot additional
memory to a variable in Standard Forth.

You can also reserve memory without creating a new word:

@example
here 10 cells allot .
here .
@end example

The first @code{here} pushes the start address of the memory area, the
second @code{here} the address after the dictionary area.  You should
store the start address somewhere, or you will have a hard time
finding the memory area again.

@code{Allot} manages dictionary memory.  The dictionary memory contains
the system's data structures for words etc. on Gforth and most other
Forth systems.  It is managed like a stack: You can free the memory that
you have just @code{allot}ed with

@example
-10 cells allot
here .
@end example

Note that you cannot do this if you have created a new word in the
meantime (because then your @code{allot}ed memory is no longer on the
top of the dictionary ``stack'').

Alternatively, you can use @code{allocate} and @code{free} which allow
freeing memory in any order:

@example
10 cells allocate throw .s
20 cells allocate throw .s
swap
free throw
free throw
@end example

The @code{throw}s deal with errors (e.g., out of memory).

And there is also a
@uref{https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/garbage-collection.zip,
garbage collector}, which eliminates the need to @code{free} memory
explicitly.

@node Characters and Strings Tutorial, Alignment Tutorial, Memory Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Characters and Strings
@cindex strings tutorial
@cindex characters tutorial

On the stack characters take up a cell, like numbers.  In memory they
have their own size (one 8-bit byte on most systems), and therefore
require their own words for memory access:

@example
create v4 
  104 c, 97 c, 108 c, 108 c, 111 c,
v4 4 chars + c@@ .
v4 5 chars dump
@end example

The preferred representation of strings on the stack is @code{addr
u-count}, where @code{addr} is the address of the first character and
@code{u-count} is the number of characters in the string.

@example
v4 5 type
@end example

You get a string constant with

@example
s" hello, world" .s
type
@end example

Make sure you have a space between @code{s"} and the string; @code{s"}
is a normal Forth word and must be delimited with white space (try what
happens when you remove the space).

However, this interpretive use of @code{s"} is quite restricted: the
string exists only until the next call of @code{s"} (some Forth systems
keep more than one of these strings, but usually they still have a
limited lifetime).

@example
s" hello," s" world" .s
type
type
@end example

You can also use @code{s"} in a definition, and the resulting
strings then live forever (well, for as long as the definition):

@example
: foo s" hello," s" world" ;
foo .s
type

@node Alignment Tutorial, Floating Point Tutorial, Characters and Strings Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Alignment
@cindex alignment tutorial
@cindex memory alignment tutorial

On many processors cells have to be aligned in memory, if you want to
access them with @code{@@} and @code{!} (and even if the processor does
not require alignment, access to aligned cells is faster).

@code{Create} aligns @code{here} (i.e., the place where the next
allocation will occur, and that the @code{create}d word points to).
Likewise, the memory produced by @code{allocate} starts at an aligned
address.  Adding a number of @code{cells} to an aligned address produces
another aligned address.

However, address arithmetic involving @code{char+} and @code{chars} can
create an address that is not cell-aligned.  @code{Aligned ( addr --
a-addr )} produces the next aligned address:

@example
v3 char+ aligned .s @@ .
v3 char+ .s @@ .
@end example

Similarly, @code{align} advances @code{here} to the next aligned
address:

@example
create v5 97 c,
here .
align here .
1000 ,
@end example

Note that you should use aligned addresses even if your processor does
not require them, if you want your program to be portable.

@node Floating Point Tutorial, Files Tutorial, Alignment Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Floating Point
@cindex floating point tutorial
@cindex FP tutorial

Floating-point (FP) numbers and arithmetic in Forth works mostly as one
might expect, but there are a few things worth noting:

The first point is not specific to Forth, but so important and yet not
universally known that I mention it here: FP numbers are not reals.
Many properties (e.g., arithmetic laws) that reals have and that one
expects of all kinds of numbers do not hold for FP numbers.  If you
want to use FP computations, you should learn about their problems and
how to avoid them; a good starting point is @cite{David Goldberg,
@uref{https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html,What Every
Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic}, ACM
Computing Surveys 23(1):5@minus{}48, March 1991}.

In Forth source code literal FP numbers need an exponent, e.g.,
@code{1e0}; this can also be written shorter as @code{1e}, longer as
@code{+1.0e+0}, and many variations in between.  The reason for this is
that, for historical reasons, Forth interprets a decimal point alone
(e.g., @code{1.}) as indicating a double-cell integer.  Examples:

@example
2e 2e f+ f.
@end example

Another requirement for literal FP numbers is that the current base is
decimal; with a hex base @code{1e} is interpreted as an integer.

Forth has a separate stack for FP numbers in conformance with
Forth-2012.  One advantage of this model is that cells are not in the
way when accessing FP values, and vice versa.  Forth has a set of
words for manipulating the FP stack: @code{fdup fswap fdrop fover
frot} and (non-standard) @code{fnip ftuck fpick}.

FP arithmetic words are prefixed with @code{F}.  There is the usual
set @code{f+ f- f* f/ f** fnegate} as well as a number of words for
other functions, e.g., @code{fsqrt fsin fln fmin}.  One word that you
might expect is @code{f=}; but @code{f=} is non-standard, because FP
computation results are usually inaccurate, so exact comparison is
usually a mistake, and one should use approximate comparison.
Unfortunately, @code{f~}, the standard word for that purpose, is not
well designed, so Gforth provides @code{f~abs} and @code{f~rel} as
well.

And of course there are words for accessing FP numbers in memory
(@code{f@@ f!}), and for address arithmetic (@code{floats float+
faligned}).  There are also variants of these words with an @code{sf}
and @code{df} prefix for accessing IEEE format single-precision and
double-precision numbers in memory; their main purpose is for
accessing external FP data (e.g., that has been read from or will be
written to a file).

Here is an example of a dot-product word and its use:

@example
: v* ( f_addr1 nstride1 f_addr2 nstride2 ucount -- r )
  >r swap 2swap swap 0e r> 0 ?DO
    dup f@@ over + 2swap dup f@@ f* f+ over + 2swap
  LOOP
  2drop 2drop ;

create v 1.23e f, 4.56e f, 7.89e f,

v 1 floats  v 1 floats  3  v* f.

@node Files Tutorial, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics and Immediacy Tutorial, Floating Point Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Files
@cindex files tutorial

This section gives a short introduction into how to use files inside
Forth. It's broken up into five easy steps:

@enumerate 1
@item Open an ASCII text file for input
@item Open a file for output
@item Read input file until string matches (or some other condition is met)
@item Write some lines from input (modified or not) to output
@item Close the files.
@end enumerate

Reference: @ref{General files}.

@subsection Open file for input

@example
s" foo.in"  r/o open-file throw Value fd-in
@end example

@subsection Create file for output

@example
s" foo.out" w/o create-file throw Value fd-out
@end example

The available file modes are r/o for read-only access, r/w for
read-write access, and w/o for write-only access. You could open both
files with r/w, too, if you like. All file words return error codes; for
most applications, it's best to pass there error codes with @code{throw}
to the outer error handler.

If you want words for opening and assigning, define them as follows:

@example
0 Value fd-in
0 Value fd-out
: open-input ( addr u -- )  r/o open-file throw to fd-in ;
: open-output ( addr u -- )  w/o create-file throw to fd-out ;
@end example

Usage example:

@example
s" foo.in" open-input
s" foo.out" open-output
@end example

@subsection Scan file for a particular line

@example
256 Constant max-line
Create line-buffer  max-line 2 + allot

: scan-file ( addr u -- )
  begin
      line-buffer max-line fd-in read-line throw
  while
         >r 2dup line-buffer r> compare 0=
     until
  else
     drop
  then
  2drop ;
@end example

@code{read-line ( addr u1 fd -- u2 flag ior )} reads up to u1 bytes into
the buffer at addr, and returns the number of bytes read, a flag that is
false when the end of file is reached, and an error code.

@code{compare ( addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- n )} compares two strings and
returns zero if both strings are equal. It returns a positive number if
the first string is lexically greater, a negative if the second string
is lexically greater.

We haven't seen this loop here; it has two exits. Since the @code{while}
exits with the number of bytes read on the stack, we have to clean up
that separately; that's after the @code{else}.

Usage example:

@example
s" The text I search is here" scan-file
@end example

@subsection Copy input to output

@example
: copy-file ( -- )
  begin
      line-buffer max-line fd-in read-line throw
  while
      line-buffer swap fd-out write-line throw
  repeat 
  drop ;
@end example
@c !! does not handle long lines, no newline at end of file

@subsection Close files

@example
fd-in close-file throw
fd-out close-file throw
@end example

Likewise, you can put that into definitions, too:

@example
: close-input ( -- )  fd-in close-file throw ;
: close-output ( -- )  fd-out close-file throw ;
@end example

@section Interpretation and Compilation Semantics and Immediacy
@cindex semantics tutorial
@cindex interpretation semantics tutorial
@cindex compilation semantics tutorial
@cindex immediate, tutorial

When a word is compiled, it behaves differently from being interpreted.
E.g., consider @code{+}:

@example
1 2 + .
: foo + ;
@end example

These two behaviours are known as compilation and interpretation
semantics.  For normal words (e.g., @code{+}), the compilation semantics
is to append the interpretation semantics to the currently defined word
(@code{foo} in the example above).  I.e., when @code{foo} is executed
later, the interpretation semantics of @code{+} (i.e., adding two
numbers) will be performed.

However, there are words with non-default compilation semantics, e.g.,
the control-flow words like @code{if}.  You can use @code{immediate} to
change the compilation semantics of the last defined word to be equal to
the interpretation semantics:

@example
: [FOO] ( -- )
 5 . ; immediate

[FOO]
: bar ( -- )
  [FOO] ;
bar
see bar
@end example

Two conventions to mark words with non-default compilation semantics are
names with brackets (more frequently used) and to write them all in
upper case (less frequently used).

For some words, such as @code{if}, using their interpretation
semantics is usually a mistake, so we mark them as @code{compile-only}, and you get a warning when you interpret them.

@example
: flip ( -- )
 6 . ; compile-only \ but not immediate
flip

: flop ( -- )
 flip ;
flop
@end example

In this example, first the interpretation semantics of @code{flip} is
used (and you get a warning); the second use of @code{flip} uses the
compilation semantics (and you get no warning).  You can also see in
this example that compile-only is a property that is evaluated at text
interpretation time, not at run-time.

The text interpreter has two states: in interpret state, it performs the
interpretation semantics of words it encounters; in compile state, it
performs the compilation semantics of these words.

Among other things, @code{:} switches into compile state, and @code{;}
switches back to interpret state.  They contain the factors @code{]}
(switch to compile state) and @code{[} (switch to interpret state), that
do nothing but switch the state.

@example
: xxx ( -- )
  [ 5 . ]
;

xxx
see xxx
@end example

These brackets are also the source of the naming convention mentioned
above.

@node Execution Tokens Tutorial, Exceptions Tutorial, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics and Immediacy Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Execution Tokens
@cindex execution tokens tutorial
@cindex XT tutorial

@code{' word} gives you the execution token (XT) of a word.  The XT is a
cell representing the interpretation semantics of a word.  You can
execute these semantics with @code{execute}:

@example
' + .s
1 2 rot execute .
@end example

The XT is similar to a function pointer in C.  However, parameter
passing through the stack makes it a little more flexible:

@example
: map-array ( ... addr u xt -- ... )
\ executes xt ( ... x -- ... ) for every element of the array starting
\ at addr and containing u elements
  @{ xt @}
  cells over + swap ?do
    i @@ xt execute
  1 cells +loop ;

create a 3 , 4 , 2 , -1 , 4 ,
a 5 ' . map-array .s
0 a 5 ' + map-array .
s" max-n" environment? drop .s
a 5 ' min map-array .
@end example

You can use map-array with the XTs of words that consume one element
more than they produce.  In theory you can also use it with other XTs,
but the stack effect then depends on the size of the array, which is
hard to understand.

Since XTs are cell-sized, you can store them in memory and manipulate
them on the stack like other cells.  You can also compile the XT into a
word with @code{compile,}:

@example
: foo1 ( n1 n2 -- n )
   [ ' + compile, ] ;
see foo1
@end example

This is non-standard, because @code{compile,} has no compilation
semantics in the standard, but it works in good Forth systems.  For the
broken ones, use

@example
: [compile,] compile, ; immediate

: foo1 ( n1 n2 -- n )
   [ ' + ] [compile,] ;
see foo1
@end example

@code{'} is a word with default compilation semantics; it parses the
next word when its interpretation semantics are executed, not during
compilation:

@example
: foo ( -- xt )
  ' ;
see foo
: bar ( ... "word" -- ... )
  ' execute ;
see bar
1 2 bar + .
@end example

You often want to parse a word during compilation and compile its XT so
it will be pushed on the stack at run-time.  @code{[']} does this:

@example
: xt-+ ( -- xt )
  ['] + ;
see xt-+
1 2 xt-+ execute .
@end example

Many programmers tend to see @code{'} and the word it parses as one
unit, and expect it to behave like @code{[']} when compiled, and are
confused by the actual behaviour.  If you are, just remember that the
Forth system just takes @code{'} as one unit and has no idea that it is
a parsing word (attempts to convenience programmers in this issue have
usually resulted in even worse pitfalls, see
@uref{https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/ertl98.ps.gz,
@samp{State}-smartness---Why it is evil and How to Exorcise it}).

Note that the state of the interpreter does not come into play when
creating and executing XTs.  I.e., even when you execute @code{'} in
compile state, it still gives you the interpretation semantics.  And
whatever that state is, @code{execute} performs the semantics
represented by the XT (i.e., for XTs produced with @code{'} the
interpretation semantics).

@node Exceptions Tutorial, Defining Words Tutorial, Execution Tokens Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Exceptions
@cindex exceptions tutorial

@code{throw ( n -- )} causes an exception unless n is zero.

@example
100 throw .s
0 throw .s
@end example

@code{catch ( ... xt -- ... n )} behaves similar to @code{execute}, but
it catches exceptions and pushes the number of the exception on the
stack (or 0, if the xt executed without exception).  If there was an
exception, the stacks have the same depth as when entering @code{catch}:

@example
.s
3 0 ' / catch .s
3 2 ' / catch .s
@end example

@quotation Assignment
Try the same with @code{execute} instead of @code{catch}.
@end quotation

@code{Throw} always jumps to the dynamically next enclosing
@code{catch}, even if it has to leave several call levels to achieve
this:

@example
: foo 100 throw ;
: foo1 foo ." after foo" ;
: bar ['] foo1 catch ;
bar .
@end example

It is often important to restore a value upon leaving a definition, even
if the definition is left through an exception.  You can ensure this
like this:

@example
: ...
   save-x
   ['] word-changing-x catch ( ... n )
   restore-x
   ( ... n ) throw ;
@end example

However, this is still not safe against, e.g., the user pressing
@kbd{Ctrl-C} when execution is between the @code{catch} and
@code{restore-x}.

Gforth provides an alternative exception handling syntax that is safe
against such cases: @code{try ... restore ... endtry}.  If the code
between @code{try} and @code{endtry} has an exception, the stack
depths are restored, the exception number is pushed on the stack, and
the execution continues right after @code{restore}.

The safer equivalent to the restoration code above is

@example
: ...
  save-x
  try
    word-changing-x 0
  restore
    restore-x
  endtry
  throw ;
@end example

@section Defining Words
@cindex defining words tutorial
@cindex does> tutorial
@cindex create...does> tutorial

@c before semantics?

@code{:}, @code{create}, and @code{variable} are definition words: They
define other words.  @code{Constant} is another definition word:

@example
5 constant foo
foo .
@end example

You can also use the prefixes @code{2} (double-cell) and @code{f}
(floating point) with @code{variable} and @code{constant}.

You can also define your own defining words.  E.g.:

@example
: variable ( "name" -- )
  create 0 , ;
@end example

You can also define defining words that create words that do something
other than just producing their address:

@example
: constant ( n "name" -- )
  create ,
does> ( -- n )
  ( addr ) @@ ;

5 constant foo
foo .
@end example

The definition of @code{constant} above ends at the @code{does>}; i.e.,
@code{does>} replaces @code{;}, but it also does something else: It
changes the last defined word such that it pushes the address of the
body of the word and then performs the code after the @code{does>}
whenever it is called.

In the example above, @code{constant} uses @code{,} to store 5 into the
body of @code{foo}.  When @code{foo} executes, it pushes the address of
the body onto the stack, then (in the code after the @code{does>})
fetches the 5 from there.

The stack comment near the @code{does>} reflects the stack effect of the
defined word, not the stack effect of the code after the @code{does>}
(the difference is that the code expects the address of the body that
the stack comment does not show).

You can use these definition words to do factoring in cases that involve
(other) definition words.  E.g., a field offset is always added to an
address.  Instead of defining

@example
2 cells constant offset-field1
@end example

and using this like

@example
( addr ) offset-field1 +
@end example

you can define a definition word

@example
: simple-field ( n "name" -- )
  create ,
does> ( n1 -- n1+n )
  ( addr ) @@ + ;
@end example

Definition and use of field offsets now look like this:

@example
2 cells simple-field field1
create mystruct 4 cells allot
mystruct .s field1 .s drop
@end example

If you want to do something with the word without performing the code
after the @code{does>}, you can access the body of a @code{create}d word
with @code{>body ( xt -- addr )}:

@example
: value ( n "name" -- )
  create ,
does> ( -- n1 )
  @@ ;
: to ( n "name" -- )
  ' >body ! ;

5 value foo
foo .
7 to foo
foo .
@end example

@quotation Assignment
Define @code{defer ( "name" -- )}, which creates a word that stores an
XT (at the start the XT of @code{abort}), and upon execution
@code{execute}s the XT.  Define @code{is ( xt "name" -- )} that stores
@code{xt} into @code{name}, a word defined with @code{defer}.  Indirect
recursion is one application of @code{defer}.

@node Arrays and Records Tutorial, POSTPONE Tutorial, Defining Words Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Arrays and Records
@cindex arrays tutorial
@cindex records tutorial
@cindex structs tutorial

Forth has no standard words for defining arrays, but you can build
them yourself based on address arithmetic.  You can also define words
for defining arrays and records (@pxref{Defining Words Tutorial,,
Defining Words}).

One of the first projects a Forth newcomer sets out upon when learning
about defining words is an array defining word (possibly for
n-dimensional arrays).  Go ahead and do it, I did it, too; you will
learn something from it.  However, don't be disappointed when you later
learn that you have little use for these words (inappropriate use would
be even worse).  I have not found a set of useful array words yet;
the needs are just too diverse, and named, global arrays (the result of
naive use of defining words) are often not flexible enough (e.g.,
consider how to pass them as parameters).  Another such project is a set
of words to help dealing with strings.

On the other hand, there is a useful set of record words, and it has
been defined in @file{compat/struct.fs}; these words are predefined in
Gforth.  They are explained in depth elsewhere in this manual (see
@pxref{Structures}).  The @code{simple-field} example above is
simplified variant of fields in this package.


@node POSTPONE Tutorial, Literal Tutorial, Arrays and Records Tutorial, Tutorial
@section @code{POSTPONE}
@cindex postpone tutorial

You can compile the compilation semantics (instead of compiling the
interpretation semantics) of a word with @code{POSTPONE}:

@example
: MY-+ ( Compilation: -- ; Run-time of compiled code: n1 n2 -- n )
 POSTPONE + ; immediate
: foo ( n1 n2 -- n )
 MY-+ ;
1 2 foo .
see foo
@end example

During the definition of @code{foo} the text interpreter performs the
compilation semantics of @code{MY-+}, which performs the compilation
semantics of @code{+}, i.e., it compiles @code{+} into @code{foo}.

This example also displays separate stack comments for the compilation
semantics and for the stack effect of the compiled code.  For words with
default compilation semantics these stack effects are usually not
displayed; the stack effect of the compilation semantics is always
@code{( -- )} for these words, the stack effect for the compiled code is
the stack effect of the interpretation semantics.

Note that the state of the interpreter does not come into play when
performing the compilation semantics in this way.  You can also perform
it interpretively, e.g.:

@example
: foo2 ( n1 n2 -- n )
 [ MY-+ ] ;
1 2 foo .
see foo
@end example

However, there are some broken Forth systems where this does not always
work, and therefore this practice was been declared non-standard in
1999.
@c !! repair.fs

Here is another example for using @code{POSTPONE}:

@example
: MY-- ( Compilation: -- ; Run-time of compiled code: n1 n2 -- n )
 POSTPONE negate POSTPONE + ; immediate compile-only
: bar ( n1 n2 -- n )
  MY-- ;
2 1 bar .
see bar
@end example

You can define @code{ENDIF} (which you can use instead of @code{THEN})
in this way:

@example
: ENDIF ( Compilation: orig -- )
  POSTPONE then ; immediate
@end example

@quotation Assignment
Write @code{MY-2DUP} that has compilation semantics equivalent to
@code{2dup}, but compiles @code{over over}.
@end quotation

@c !! @xref{Macros} for reference


@node Literal Tutorial, Advanced macros Tutorial, POSTPONE Tutorial, Tutorial
@section @code{Literal}
@cindex literal tutorial

You cannot @code{POSTPONE} numbers:

@example
: [FOO] POSTPONE 500 ; immediate
@end example

Instead, you can use @code{LITERAL (compilation: n --; run-time: -- n )}:

@example
: [FOO] ( compilation: --; run-time: -- n )
  500 POSTPONE literal ; immediate

: flip [FOO] ;
flip .
see flip
@end example

@code{LITERAL} consumes a number at compile-time (when it's compilation
semantics are executed) and pushes it at run-time (when the code it
compiled is executed).  A frequent use of @code{LITERAL} is to compile a
number computed at compile time into the current word:

@example
: bar ( -- n )
  [ 2 2 + ] literal ;
see bar
@end example

@quotation Assignment
Write @code{]L} which allows writing the example above as @code{: bar (
-- n ) [ 2 2 + ]L ;}
@end quotation

@cindex run-time code generation, tutorial

Reconsider @code{map-array} from @ref{Execution Tokens Tutorial,,
Execution Tokens}.  It frequently performs @code{execute}, a relatively
expensive operation in some Forth implementations.  You can use
@code{compile,} and @code{POSTPONE} to eliminate these @code{execute}s
and produce a word that contains the word to be performed directly:

@c use ]] ... [[
@example
: compile-map-array ( compilation: xt -- ; run-time: ... addr u -- ... )
\ at run-time, execute xt ( ... x -- ... ) for each element of the
\ array beginning at addr and containing u elements
  @{ xt @}
  POSTPONE cells POSTPONE over POSTPONE + POSTPONE swap POSTPONE ?do
    POSTPONE i POSTPONE @@ xt compile,
  1 cells POSTPONE literal POSTPONE +loop ;

: sum-array ( addr u -- n )
 0 rot rot [ ' + compile-map-array ] ;
see sum-array
a 5 sum-array .
@end example

You can use the full power of Forth for generating the code; here's an
example where the code is generated in a loop:

@example
: compile-vmul-step ( compilation: n --; run-time: n1 addr1 -- n2 addr2 )
\ n2=n1+(addr1)*n, addr2=addr1+cell
  POSTPONE tuck POSTPONE @@
  POSTPONE literal POSTPONE * POSTPONE +
  POSTPONE swap POSTPONE cell+ ;

: compile-vmul ( compilation: addr1 u -- ; run-time: addr2 -- n )
\ n=v1*v2 (inner product), where the v_i are represented as addr_i u
  0 postpone literal postpone swap
  [ ' compile-vmul-step compile-map-array ]
  postpone drop ;
see compile-vmul

: a-vmul ( addr -- n )
\ n=a*v, where v is a vector that's as long as a and starts at addr
 [ a 5 compile-vmul ] ;
see a-vmul
a a-vmul .
@end example

This example uses @code{compile-map-array} to show off, but you could
also use @code{map-array} instead (try it now!).

You can use this technique for efficient multiplication of large
matrices.  In matrix multiplication, you multiply every row of one
matrix with every column of the other matrix.  You can generate the code
for one row once, and use it for every column.  The only downside of
this technique is that it is cumbersome to recover the memory consumed
by the generated code when you are done (and in more complicated cases
it is not possible portably).

This section is Gforth-specific.  You can skip it.

@code{' word compile,} compiles the interpretation semantics.  For words
with default compilation semantics this is the same as performing the
compilation semantics.  To represent the compilation semantics of other
words (e.g., words like @code{if} that have no interpretation
semantics), Gforth has the concept of a compilation token (CT,
consisting of two cells), and words @code{comp'} and @code{[comp']}.
You can perform the compilation semantics represented by a CT with
@code{execute}:

@example
: foo2 ( n1 n2 -- n )
   [ comp' + execute ] ;
see foo
@end example

You can compile the compilation semantics represented by a CT with
@code{postpone,}:

@example
: foo3 ( -- )
  [ comp' + postpone, ] ;
see foo3
@end example

@code{[ comp' word postpone, ]} is equivalent to @code{POSTPONE word}.
@code{comp'} is particularly useful for words that have no
interpretation semantics:

@example
' if
comp' if .s 2drop
@end example

@node Wordlists and Search Order Tutorial,  , Compilation Tokens Tutorial, Tutorial
@section Wordlists and Search Order
@cindex wordlists tutorial
@cindex search order, tutorial

The dictionary is not just a memory area that allows you to allocate
memory with @code{allot}, it also contains the Forth words, arranged in
several wordlists.  When searching for a word in a wordlist,
conceptually you start searching at the youngest and proceed towards
older words (in reality most systems nowadays use hash-tables); i.e., if
you define a word with the same name as an older word, the new word
shadows the older word.

Which wordlists are searched in which order is determined by the search
order.  You can display the search order with @code{order}.  It displays
first the search order, starting with the wordlist searched first, then
it displays the wordlist that will contain newly defined words.

You can create a new, empty wordlist with @code{wordlist ( -- wid )}:

@example
wordlist constant mywords
@end example

@code{Set-current ( wid -- )} sets the wordlist that will contain newly
defined words (the @emph{current} wordlist):

@example
mywords set-current
order
@end example

Gforth does not display a name for the wordlist in @code{mywords}
because this wordlist was created anonymously with @code{wordlist}.

You can get the current wordlist with @code{get-current ( -- wid)}.  If
you want to put something into a specific wordlist without overall
effect on the current wordlist, this typically looks like this:

@example
get-current mywords set-current ( wid )
create someword
( wid ) set-current
@end example

You can write the search order with @code{set-order ( wid1 .. widn n --
)} and read it with @code{get-order ( -- wid1 .. widn n )}.  The first
searched wordlist is topmost.

@example
get-order mywords swap 1+ set-order
order
@end example

Yes, the order of wordlists in the output of @code{order} is reversed
from stack comments and the output of @code{.s} and thus unintuitive.

@quotation Assignment
Define @code{>order ( wid -- )} which adds @code{wid} as first searched
wordlist to the search order.  Define @code{previous ( -- )}, which
removes the first searched wordlist from the search order.  Experiment
with boundary conditions (you will see some crashes or situations that
are hard or impossible to leave).
@end quotation

The search order is a powerful foundation for providing features similar
to Modula-2 modules and C++ namespaces.  However, trying to modularize
programs in this way has disadvantages for debugging and reuse/factoring
that overcome the advantages in my experience (I don't do huge projects,
though).  These disadvantages are not so clear in other
languages/programming environments, because these languages are not so
strong in debugging and reuse.

@chapter An Introduction to Standard Forth
@cindex Forth - an introduction

The difference of this chapter from the Tutorial (@pxref{Tutorial}) is
that it is slower-paced in its examples, but uses them to dive deep into
explaining Forth internals (not covered by the Tutorial).  Apart from
that, this chapter covers far less material.  It is suitable for reading
without using a computer.

The primary purpose of this manual is to document Gforth. However, since
Forth is not a widely-known language and there is a lack of up-to-date
teaching material, it seems worthwhile to provide some introductory
material.  For other sources of Forth-related
information, see @ref{Forth-related information}.

The examples in this section should work on any Standard Forth; the
output shown was produced using Gforth. Each example attempts to
reproduce the exact output that Gforth produces. If you try out the
examples (and you should), what you should type is shown @kbd{like this}
and Gforth's response is shown @code{like this}. The single exception is
that, where the example shows @key{RET} it means that you should
press the ``carriage return'' key. Unfortunately, some output formats for
this manual cannot show the difference between @kbd{this} and
@code{this} which will make trying out the examples harder (but not
impossible).

Forth is an unusual language. It provides an interactive development
environment which includes both an interpreter and compiler. Forth
programming style encourages you to break a problem down into many
@cindex factoring
small fragments (@dfn{factoring}), and then to develop and test each
fragment interactively. Forth advocates assert that breaking the
edit-compile-test cycle used by conventional programming languages can
lead to great productivity improvements.

@c IMO this is too detailed and the pace is too slow for
@c an introduction.  If you know German, take a look at
@c https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/lvas/skriptum-stack.html 
@c to see how I do it - anton 

@c nac-> Where I have accepted your comments 100% and modified the text
@c accordingly, I have deleted your comments. Elsewhere I have added a
@c response like this to attempt to rationalise what I have done. Of
@c course, this is a very clumsy mechanism for something that would be
@c done far more efficiently over a beer. Please delete any dialogue
@c you consider closed.

When you invoke the Forth image, you will see a startup banner printed
and nothing else (if you have Gforth installed on your system, try
invoking it now, by typing @kbd{gforth@key{RET}}). Forth is now running
its command line interpreter, which is called the @dfn{Text Interpreter}
(also known as the @dfn{Outer Interpreter}).  (You will learn a lot
about the text interpreter as you read through this chapter, for more
detail @pxref{The Text Interpreter}).

Although it's not obvious, Forth is actually waiting for your
input. Type a number and press the @key{RET} key:

@example
@kbd{45@key{RET}}  ok
@end example

Rather than give you a prompt to invite you to input something, the text
interpreter prints a status message @i{after} it has processed a line
of input. The status message in this case (``@code{ ok}'' followed by
carriage-return) indicates that the text interpreter was able to process
all of your input successfully. Now type something illegal:

@example
@kbd{qwer341@key{RET}}
*the terminal*:2: Undefined word
>>>qwer341<<<
Backtrace:
$2A95B42A20 throw 
$2A95B57FB8 no.extensions 
@end example

The exact text, other than the ``Undefined word'' may differ slightly
on your system, but the effect is the same; when the text interpreter
detects an error, it discards any remaining text on a line, resets
certain internal state and prints an error message. For a detailed
description of error messages see @ref{Error messages}.

The text interpreter waits for you to press carriage-return, and then
processes your input line. Starting at the beginning of the line, it
breaks the line into groups of characters separated by spaces. For each
group of characters in turn, it makes two attempts to do something:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex name dictionary
It tries to treat it as a command. It does this by searching a @dfn{name
dictionary}. If the group of characters matches an entry in the name
dictionary, the name dictionary provides the text interpreter with
information that allows the text interpreter to perform some actions. In
Forth jargon, we say that the group
@cindex word
@cindex definition
@cindex execution token
@cindex xt
of characters names a @dfn{word}, that the dictionary search returns an
@dfn{execution token (xt)} corresponding to the @dfn{definition} of the
word, and that the text interpreter executes the xt. Often, the terms
@dfn{word} and @dfn{definition} are used interchangeably.
@item
If the text interpreter fails to find a match in the name dictionary, it
tries to treat the group of characters as a number in the current number
base (when you start up Forth, the current number base is base 10). If
the group of characters legitimately represents a number, the text
interpreter pushes the number onto a stack (we'll learn more about that
in the next section).
@end itemize

If the text interpreter is unable to do either of these things with any
group of characters, it discards the group of characters and the rest of
the line, then prints an error message. If the text interpreter reaches
the end of the line without error, it prints the status message ``@code{ ok}''
followed by carriage-return.

This is the simplest command we can give to the text interpreter:

@example
@key{RET}  ok
@end example

The text interpreter did everything we asked it to do (nothing) without
an error, so it said that everything is ``@code{ ok}''. Try a slightly longer
command:

@example
@kbd{12 dup fred dup@key{RET}}
*the terminal*:3: Undefined word
12 dup >>>fred<<< dup
Backtrace:
$2A95B42A20 throw 
$2A95B57FB8 no.extensions 
@end example

When you press the carriage-return key, the text interpreter starts to
work its way along the line:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When it gets to the space after the @code{2}, it takes the group of
characters @code{12} and looks them up in the name
dictionary@footnote{We can't tell if it found them or not, but assume
for now that it did not}. There is no match for this group of characters
in the name dictionary, so it tries to treat them as a number. It is
able to do this successfully, so it puts the number, 12, ``on the stack''
(whatever that means).
@item
The text interpreter resumes scanning the line and gets the next group
of characters, @code{dup}. It looks it up in the name dictionary and
(you'll have to take my word for this) finds it, and executes the word
@code{dup} (whatever that means).
@item
Once again, the text interpreter resumes scanning the line and gets the
group of characters @code{fred}. It looks them up in the name
dictionary, but can't find them. It tries to treat them as a number, but
they don't represent any legal number.
@end itemize

At this point, the text interpreter gives up and prints an error
message. The error message shows exactly how far the text interpreter
got in processing the line. In particular, it shows that the text
interpreter made no attempt to do anything with the final character
group, @code{dup}, even though we have good reason to believe that the
text interpreter would have no problem looking that word up and
executing it a second time.

In Forth, the equivalent of the function or procedure is the
@dfn{definition} and parameters are implicitly passed between
definitions using a shared stack that is visible to the
programmer. Although Forth does support variables, the existence of the
stack means that they are used far less often than in most other
programming languages. When the text interpreter encounters a number, it
will place (@dfn{push}) it on the stack. There are several stacks (the
actual number is implementation-dependent ...) and the particular stack
used for any operation is implied unambiguously by the operation being
performed. The stack used for all integer operations is called the @dfn{data
stack} and, since this is the stack used most commonly, references to
``the data stack'' are often abbreviated to ``the stack''.

The stacks have a last-in, first-out (LIFO) organisation. If you type:

@example
@kbd{1 2 3@key{RET}}  ok
@end example

Then this instructs the text interpreter to placed three numbers on the
(data) stack. An analogy for the behaviour of the stack is to take a
pack of playing cards and deal out the ace (1), 2 and 3 into a pile on
the table. The 3 was the last card onto the pile (``last-in'') and if
you take a card off the pile then, unless you're prepared to fiddle a
bit, the card that you take off will be the 3 (``first-out''). The
number that will be first-out of the stack is called the @dfn{top of
stack}, which
@cindex TOS definition
is often abbreviated to @dfn{TOS}.

To understand how parameters are passed in Forth, consider the
behaviour of the definition @code{+} (pronounced ``plus''). You will not
be surprised to learn that this definition performs addition. More
precisely, it adds two numbers together and produces a result. Where does
it get the two numbers from? It takes the top two numbers off the
stack. Where does it place the result? On the stack. You can act out the
behaviour of @code{+} with your playing cards like this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Pick up two cards from the stack on the table
@item
Stare at them intently and ask yourself ``what @i{is} the sum of these two
numbers''
@item
Decide that the answer is 5
@item
Shuffle the two cards back into the pack and find a 5
@item
Put a 5 on the remaining ace that's on the table.
@end itemize

If you don't have a pack of cards handy but you do have Forth running,
you can use the definition @code{.s} to show the current state of the stack,
without affecting the stack. Type:

@example
@kbd{clearstacks 1 2 3@key{RET}} ok
@kbd{.s@key{RET}} <3> 1 2 3  ok
@end example

The text interpreter looks up the word @code{clearstacks} and executes
it; it tidies up the stacks (data and floating point stack) and
removes any entries that may have been left on them by earlier
examples. The text interpreter pushes each of the three numbers in
turn onto the stack. Finally, the text interpreter looks up the word
@code{.s} and executes it. The effect of executing @code{.s} is to
print the ``<3>'' (the total number of items on the stack) followed by
a list of all the items on the stack; the item on the far right-hand
side is the TOS.

You can now type:

@example
@kbd{+ .s@key{RET}} <2> 1 5  ok
@end example

@noindent
which is correct; there are now 2 items on the stack and the result of
the addition is 5.

If you're playing with cards, try doing a second addition: pick up the
two cards, work out that their sum is 6, shuffle them into the pack,
look for a 6 and place that on the table. You now have just one item on
the stack. What happens if you try to do a third addition? Pick up the
first card, pick up the second card -- ah! There is no second card. This
is called a @dfn{stack underflow} and constitutes an error. If you try to
do the same thing with Forth it often reports an error (probably a Stack
Underflow or an Invalid Memory Address error).

The opposite situation to a stack underflow is a @dfn{stack overflow},
which simply accepts that there is a finite amount of storage space
reserved for the stack. To stretch the playing card analogy, if you had
enough packs of cards and you piled the cards up on the table, you would
eventually be unable to add another card; you'd hit the ceiling. Gforth
allows you to set the maximum size of the stacks. In general, the only
time that you will get a stack overflow is because a definition has a
bug in it and is generating data on the stack uncontrollably.

There's one final use for the playing card analogy. If you model your
stack using a pack of playing cards, the maximum number of items on
your stack will be 52 (I assume you didn't use the Joker). The maximum
@i{value} of any item on the stack is 13 (the King). In fact, the only
possible numbers are positive integer numbers 1 through 13; you can't
have (for example) 0 or 27 or 3.52 or -2. If you change the way you
think about some of the cards, you can accommodate different
numbers. For example, you could think of the Jack as representing 0,
the Queen as representing -1 and the King as representing -2. Your
@i{range} remains unchanged (you can still only represent a total of 13
numbers) but the numbers that you can represent are -2 through 10.

In that analogy, the limit was the amount of information that a single
stack entry could hold, and Forth has a similar limit. In Forth, the
size of a stack entry is called a @dfn{cell}. The actual size of a cell is
implementation dependent and affects the maximum value that a stack
entry can hold. A Standard Forth provides a cell size of at least
16-bits, and most desktop systems use a cell size of 32-bits.

Forth does not do any type checking for you, so you are free to
manipulate and combine stack items in any way you wish. A convenient way
of treating stack items is as 2's complement signed integers, and that
is what Standard words like @code{+} do. Therefore you can type:

@example
@kbd{-5 12 + .s@key{RET}} <1> 7  ok
@end example

If you use numbers and definitions like @code{+} in order to turn Forth
into a great big pocket calculator, you will realise that it's rather
different from a normal calculator. Rather than typing 2 + 3 = you had
to type 2 3 + (ignore the fact that you had to use @code{.s} to see the
result). The terminology used to describe this difference is to say that
your calculator uses @dfn{Infix Notation} (parameters and operators are
mixed) whilst Forth uses @dfn{Postfix Notation} (parameters and
operators are separate), also called @dfn{Reverse Polish Notation}.

Whilst postfix notation might look confusing to begin with, it has
several important advantages:

@itemize @bullet
@item
it is unambiguous
@item
it is more concise
@item
it fits naturally with a stack-based system
@end itemize

To examine these claims in more detail, consider these sums:

@example
6 + 5 * 4 =
4 * 5 + 6 =
@end example

If you're just learning maths or your maths is very rusty, you will
probably come up with the answer 44 for the first and 26 for the
second. If you are a bit of a whizz at maths you will remember the
@i{convention} that multiplication takes precedence over addition, and
you'd come up with the answer 26 both times. To explain the answer 26
to someone who got the answer 44, you'd probably rewrite the first sum
like this:

@example
6 + (5 * 4) =
@end example

If what you really wanted was to perform the addition before the
multiplication, you would have to use parentheses to force it.

If you did the first two sums on a pocket calculator you would probably
get the right answers, unless you were very cautious and entered them using
these keystroke sequences:

6 + 5 = * 4 =
4 * 5 = + 6 =

Postfix notation is unambiguous because the order that the operators
are applied is always explicit; that also means that parentheses are
never required. The operators are @i{active} (the act of quoting the
operator makes the operation occur) which removes the need for ``=''.

The sum 6 + 5 * 4 can be written (in postfix notation) in two
equivalent ways:

@example
6 5 4 * +      or:
5 4 * 6 +
@end example

An important thing that you should notice about this notation is that
the @i{order} of the numbers does not change; if you want to subtract
2 from 10 you type @code{10 2 -}.

The reason that Forth uses postfix notation is very simple to explain: it
makes the implementation extremely simple, and it follows naturally from
using the stack as a mechanism for passing parameters. Another way of
thinking about this is to realise that all Forth definitions are
@i{active}; they execute as they are encountered by the text
interpreter. The result of this is that the syntax of Forth is trivially
simple.



@comment ----------------------------------------------
@node Your first definition, How does that work?, Stacks and Postfix notation, Introduction
@section Your first Forth definition
@cindex first definition

Until now, the examples we've seen have been trivial; we've just been
using Forth as a bigger-than-pocket calculator. Also, each calculation
we've shown has been a ``one-off'' -- to repeat it we'd need to type it in
again@footnote{That's not quite true. If you press the up-arrow key on
your keyboard you should be able to scroll back to any earlier command,
edit it and re-enter it.} In this section we'll see how to add new
words to Forth's vocabulary.

The easiest way to create a new word is to use a @dfn{colon
definition}. We'll define a few and try them out before worrying too
much about how they work. Try typing in these examples; be careful to
copy the spaces accurately:

@example
: add-two 2 + . ;
: greet ." Hello and welcome" ;
: demo 5 add-two ;
@end example

@noindent
Now try them out:

@example
@kbd{greet@key{RET}} Hello and welcome  ok
@kbd{greet greet@key{RET}} Hello and welcomeHello and welcome  ok
@kbd{4 add-two@key{RET}} 6  ok
@kbd{demo@key{RET}} 7  ok
@kbd{9 greet demo add-two@key{RET}} Hello and welcome7 11  ok
@end example

The first new thing that we've introduced here is the pair of words
@code{:} and @code{;}. These are used to start and terminate a new
definition, respectively. The first word after the @code{:} is the name
for the new definition.

As you can see from the examples, a definition is built up of words that
have already been defined; Forth makes no distinction between
definitions that existed when you started the system up, and those that
you define yourself.

The examples also introduce the words @code{.} (dot), @code{."}
(dot-quote) and @code{dup} (dewp). Dot takes the value from the top of
the stack and displays it. It's like @code{.s} except that it only
displays the top item of the stack and it is destructive; after it has
executed, the number is no longer on the stack. There is always one
space printed after the number, and no spaces before it. Dot-quote
defines a string (a sequence of characters) that will be printed when
the word is executed. The string can contain any printable characters
except @code{"}. A @code{"} has a special function; it is not a Forth
word but it acts as a delimiter (the way that delimiters work is
described in the next section). Finally, @code{dup} duplicates the value
at the top of the stack. Try typing @code{5 dup .s} to see what it does.

We already know that the text interpreter searches through the
dictionary to locate names. If you've followed the examples earlier, you
will already have a definition called @code{add-two}. Lets try modifying
it by typing in a new definition:

@example
@kbd{: add-two dup . ." + 2 = " 2 + . ;@key{RET}} redefined add-two  ok
@end example

Forth recognised that we were defining a word that already exists, and
printed a message to warn us of that fact. Let's try out the new
definition:

@example
@kbd{9 add-two@key{RET}} 9 + 2 = 11  ok
@end example

@noindent
All that we've actually done here, though, is to create a new
definition, with a particular name. The fact that there was already a
definition with the same name did not make any difference to the way
that the new definition was created (except that Forth printed a warning
message). The old definition of add-two still exists (try @code{demo}
again to see that this is true). Any new definition will use the new
definition of @code{add-two}, but old definitions continue to use the
version that already existed at the time that they were @code{compiled}.

Before you go on to the next section, try defining and redefining some
words of your own.

@comment ----------------------------------------------
@node How does that work?, Forth is written in Forth, Your first definition, Introduction
@section How does that work?
@cindex parsing words

@c That's pretty deep (IMO way too deep) for an introduction. - anton

@c Is it a good idea to talk about the interpretation semantics of a
@c number? We don't have an xt to go along with it. - anton

@c Now that I have eliminated execution semantics, I wonder if it would not
@c be better to keep them (or add run-time semantics), to make it easier to
@c explain what compilation semantics usually does. - anton

@c nac-> I removed the term ``default compilation semantics'' from the
@c introductory chapter. Removing ``execution semantics'' was making
@c everything simpler to explain, then I think the use of this term made
@c everything more complex again. I replaced it with ``default
@c semantics'' (which is used elsewhere in the manual) by which I mean
@c ``a definition that has neither the immediate nor the compile-only
@c flag set''.

@c anton: I have eliminated default semantics (except in one place where it
@c means "default interpretation and compilation semantics"), because it
@c makes no sense in the presence of combined words.  I reverted to
@c "execution semantics" where necessary.

@c nac-> I reworded big chunks of the ``how does that work''
@c section (and, unusually for me, I think I even made it shorter!).  See
@c what you think -- I know I have not addressed your primary concern
@c that it is too heavy-going for an introduction. From what I understood
@c of your course notes it looks as though they might be a good framework. 
@c Things that I've tried to capture here are some things that came as a
@c great revelation here when I first understood them. Also, I like the
@c fact that a very simple code example shows up almost all of the issues
@c that you need to understand to see how Forth works. That's unique and
@c worthwhile to emphasise.

@c anton: I think it's a good idea to present the details, especially those
@c that you found to be a revelation, and probably the tutorial tries to be
@c too superficial and does not get some of the things across that make
@c Forth special.  I do believe that most of the time these things should
@c be discussed at the end of a section or in separate sections instead of
@c in the middle of a section (e.g., the stuff you added in "User-defined
@c defining words" leads in a completely different direction from the rest
@c of the section).

Now we're going to take another look at the definition of @code{add-two}
from the previous section. From our knowledge of the way that the text
interpreter works, we would have expected this result when we tried to
define @code{add-two}:

@example
@kbd{: add-two 2 + . ;@key{RET}}
*the terminal*:4: Undefined word
: >>>add-two<<< 2 + . ;
@end example

The reason that this didn't happen is bound up in the way that @code{:}
works. The word @code{:} does two special things. The first special
thing that it does is to prevent the text interpreter from ever seeing the
characters @code{add-two}. The text interpreter uses a variable called
@cindex modifying >IN
@code{>IN} (pronounced ``to-in'') to keep track of where it is in the
input line. When it encounters the word @code{:} it behaves in exactly
the same way as it does for any other word; it looks it up in the name
dictionary, finds its xt and executes it. When @code{:} executes, it
looks at the input buffer, finds the word @code{add-two} and advances the
value of @code{>IN} to point past it. It then does some other stuff
associated with creating the new definition (including creating an entry
for @code{add-two} in the name dictionary). When the execution of @code{:}
completes, control returns to the text interpreter, which is oblivious
to the fact that it has been tricked into ignoring part of the input
line.

@cindex parsing words
Words like @code{:} -- words that advance the value of @code{>IN} and so
prevent the text interpreter from acting on the whole of the input line
-- are called @dfn{parsing words}.

@cindex @code{state} - effect on the text interpreter
@cindex text interpreter - effect of state
The second special thing that @code{:} does is change the value of a
variable called @code{state}, which affects the way that the text
interpreter behaves. When Gforth starts up, @code{state} has the value
0, and the text interpreter is said to be @dfn{interpreting}. During a
colon definition (started with @code{:}), @code{state} is set to -1 and
the text interpreter is said to be @dfn{compiling}.

In this example, the text interpreter is compiling when it processes the
string ``@code{2 + . ;}''. It still breaks the string down into
character sequences in the same way. However, instead of pushing the
number @code{2} onto the stack, it lays down (@dfn{compiles}) some magic
into the definition of @code{add-two} that will make the number @code{2} get
pushed onto the stack when @code{add-two} is @dfn{executed}. Similarly,
the behaviours of @code{+} and @code{.} are also compiled into the
definition.

Certain kinds of words do not get compiled. These so-called @dfn{immediate
words} get executed (performed @i{now}) regardless of whether the text
interpreter is interpreting or compiling. The word @code{;} is an
immediate word. Rather than being compiled into the definition, it
executes. Its effect is to terminate the current definition, which
includes changing the value of @code{state} back to 0.

When you execute @code{add-two}, it has a @dfn{run-time effect} that is
exactly the same as if you had typed @code{2 + . @key{RET}} outside of a
definition.

In Forth, every word or number can be described in terms of two
properties:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex interpretation semantics
Its @dfn{interpretation semantics} describe how it will behave when the
text interpreter encounters it in @dfn{interpret} state. The
interpretation semantics of a word are represented by its @dfn{execution
token} (@pxref{Execution token}).
@item
@cindex compilation semantics
Its @dfn{compilation semantics} describe how it will behave when the
text interpreter encounters it in @dfn{compile} state. The compilation
semantics of a word are represented by its @dfn{compilation token}
(@pxref{Compilation token}).
@end itemize

@noindent
Numbers are always treated in a fixed way:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When the number is @dfn{interpreted}, its behaviour is to push the
number onto the stack.
@item
When the number is @dfn{compiled}, a piece of code is appended to the
current definition that pushes the number when it runs. (In other words,
the compilation semantics of a number are to postpone its interpretation
semantics until the run-time of the definition that it is being compiled
into.)
@end itemize

Words don't always behave in such a regular way, but most have @i{default
semantics} which means that they behave like this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @dfn{interpretation semantics} of the word are to do something useful.
@item
The @dfn{compilation semantics} of the word are to append its
@dfn{interpretation semantics} to the current definition (so that its
run-time behaviour is to do something useful).
@end itemize

@cindex immediate words
The actual behaviour of any particular word can be controlled by using
the words @code{immediate} and @code{compile-only} when the word is
defined. These words set flags in the name dictionary entry of the most
recently defined word, and these flags are retrieved by the text
interpreter when it finds the word in the name dictionary.

A word that is marked as @dfn{immediate} has compilation semantics that
are identical to its interpretation semantics. In other words, it
behaves like this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @dfn{interpretation semantics} of the word are to do something useful.
@item
The @dfn{compilation semantics} of the word are to do something useful
(and actually the same thing); i.e., it is executed during compilation.
@end itemize

Marking a word as @dfn{compile-only} means that the text interpreter
produces a warning when encountering this word in interpretation
state; ticking the word (with @code{'} or @code{[']} also produces a
warning.

It is never necessary to use @code{compile-only} (and it is not even
part of Standard Forth, though it is provided by many implementations)
but it is good etiquette to apply it to a word that will not behave
correctly (and might have unexpected side-effects) in interpret
state. For example, it is only legal to use the conditional word
@code{IF} within a definition. If you forget this and try to use it
elsewhere, the fact that (in Gforth) it is marked as
@code{compile-only} allows the text interpreter to generate a helpful
warning.

This example shows the difference between an immediate and a
non-immediate word:

@example
: show-state state @@ . ;
: show-state-now show-state ; immediate
: word1 show-state ;
: word2 show-state-now ;
@end example

The word @code{immediate} after the definition of @code{show-state-now}
makes that word an immediate word. These definitions introduce a new
word: @code{@@} (pronounced ``fetch''). This word fetches the value of a
variable, and leaves it on the stack. Therefore, the behaviour of
@code{show-state} is to print a number that represents the current value
of @code{state}.

When you execute @code{word1}, it prints the number 0, indicating that
the system is interpreting. When the text interpreter compiled the
definition of @code{word1}, it encountered @code{show-state} whose
compilation semantics are to append its interpretation semantics to the
current definition. When you execute @code{word1}, it performs the
interpretation semantics of @code{show-state}.  At the time that @code{word1}
(and therefore @code{show-state}) is executed, the system is
interpreting.

When you pressed @key{RET} after entering the definition of @code{word2},
you should have seen the number -1 printed, followed by ``@code{
ok}''. When the text interpreter compiled the definition of
@code{word2}, it encountered @code{show-state-now}, an immediate word,
whose compilation semantics are therefore to perform its interpretation
semantics. It is executed straight away (even before the text
interpreter has moved on to process another group of characters; the
@code{;} in this example). The effect of executing it is to display the
value of @code{state} @i{at the time that the definition of}
@code{word2} @i{is being defined}. Printing -1 demonstrates that the
system is compiling at this time. If you execute @code{word2} it does
nothing at all.

@cindex @code{."}, how it works
Before leaving the subject of immediate words, consider the behaviour of
@code{."} in the definition of @code{greet}, in the previous
section. This word is both a parsing word and an immediate word. Notice
that there is a space between @code{."} and the start of the text
@code{Hello and welcome}, but that there is no space between the last
letter of @code{welcome} and the @code{"} character. The reason for this
is that @code{."} is a Forth word; it must have a space after it so that
the text interpreter can identify it. The @code{"} is not a Forth word;
it is a @dfn{delimiter}. The examples earlier show that, when the string
is displayed, there is neither a space before the @code{H} nor after the
@code{e}. Since @code{."} is an immediate word, it executes at the time
that @code{greet} is defined. When it executes, its behaviour is to
search forward in the input line looking for the delimiter. When it
finds the delimiter, it updates @code{>IN} to point past the
delimiter. It also compiles some magic code into the definition of
@code{greet}; the xt of a run-time routine that prints a text string. It
compiles the string @code{Hello and welcome} into memory so that it is
available to be printed later. When the text interpreter gains control,
the next word it finds in the input stream is @code{;} and so it
terminates the definition of @code{greet}.


@comment ----------------------------------------------
@node Forth is written in Forth, Review - elements of a Forth system, How does that work?, Introduction
@section Forth is written in Forth
@cindex structure of Forth programs

When you start up a Forth compiler, a large number of definitions
already exist. In Forth, you develop a new application using bottom-up
programming techniques to create new definitions that are defined in
terms of existing definitions. As you create each definition you can
test and debug it interactively.

If you have tried out the examples in this section, you will probably
have typed them in by hand; when you leave Gforth, your definitions will
be lost. You can avoid this by using a text editor to enter Forth source
code into a file, and then loading code from the file using
@code{include} (@pxref{Forth source files}). A Forth source file is
processed by the text interpreter, just as though you had typed it in by
hand@footnote{Actually, there are some subtle differences -- see
@ref{The Text Interpreter}.}.

Gforth also supports the traditional Forth alternative to using text
files for program entry (@pxref{Blocks}).

In common with many, if not most, Forth compilers, most of Gforth is
actually written in Forth. All of the @file{.fs} files in the
installation directory@footnote{For example,
@file{/usr/local/share/gforth...}} are Forth source files, which you can
study to see examples of Forth programming.

Gforth maintains a history file that records every line that you type to
the text interpreter. This file is preserved between sessions, and is
used to provide a command-line recall facility. If you enter long
definitions by hand, you can use a text editor to paste them out of the
history file into a Forth source file for reuse at a later time
(for more information @pxref{Command-line editing}).

@node Review - elements of a Forth system, Where to go next, Forth is written in Forth, Introduction

To summarise this chapter:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Forth programs use @dfn{factoring} to break a problem down into small
fragments called @dfn{words} or @dfn{definitions}.
@item
Forth program development is an interactive process.
@item
The main command loop that accepts input, and controls both
interpretation and compilation, is called the @dfn{text interpreter}
(also known as the @dfn{outer interpreter}).
@item
Forth has a very simple syntax, consisting of words and numbers
separated by spaces or carriage-return characters. Any additional syntax
is imposed by @dfn{parsing words}.
@item
Forth uses a stack to pass parameters between words. As a result, it
uses postfix notation.
@item
To use a word that has previously been defined, the text interpreter
searches for the word in the @dfn{name dictionary}.
@item
Words have @dfn{interpretation semantics} and @dfn{compilation semantics}.
@item
The text interpreter uses the value of @code{state} to select between
the use of the @dfn{interpretation semantics} and the  @dfn{compilation
semantics} of a word that it encounters.
@item
The relationship between the @dfn{interpretation semantics} and
@dfn{compilation semantics} for a word
depends upon the way in which the word was defined (for example, whether
it is an @dfn{immediate} word).
@item
Forth definitions can be implemented in Forth (called @dfn{high-level
definitions}) or in some other way (usually a lower-level language and
as a result often called @dfn{low-level definitions}, @dfn{code
definitions} or @dfn{primitives}).
@item
Many Forth systems are implemented mainly in Forth.

Amazing as it may seem, if you have read (and understood) this far, you
know almost all the fundamentals about the inner workings of a Forth
system. You certainly know enough to be able to read and understand the
rest of this manual and the Standard Forth document, to learn more about the
facilities that Forth in general and Gforth in particular provide. Even
scarier, you know almost enough to implement your own Forth system.
However, that's not a good idea just yet... better to try writing some
programs in Gforth.

Forth has such a rich vocabulary that it can be hard to know where to
start in learning it. This section suggests a few sets of words that are
enough to write small but useful programs. Use the word index in this
document to learn more about each word, then try it out and try to write
small definitions using it. Start by experimenting with these words:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Arithmetic: @code{+ - * / /MOD */ ABS INVERT}
@item
Comparison: @code{MIN MAX =}
@item
Logic: @code{AND OR XOR NOT}
@item
Stack manipulation: @code{DUP DROP SWAP OVER}
@item
Loops and decisions: @code{IF ELSE THEN ?DO I LOOP}
@item
Input/Output: @code{. ." EMIT CR KEY}
@item
Defining words: @code{: ; CREATE}
@item
Memory allocation words: @code{ALLOT ,}

When you have mastered those, go on to:

@itemize @bullet
@item

When you have mastered these, there's nothing for it but to read through
the whole of this manual and find out what you've missed.

@section Integer and character literals

@cindex single-cell numbers, input format
@cindex input format for single-cell numbers
To push an integer number on the data stack, you write the number in
source code, e.g., @code{123}.  You can prefix the digits with
@code{-} to indicate a negative number, e.g. @code{-123}.  This works
both inside colon definitions and outside.  The number is interpreted
according to the value in @code{base} (@pxref{Base and integer decimal point}).
The digits are @code{0} to @code{9} and @code{a} (decimal 10) to
@code{z} (decimal 35), but only digits smaller than @code{base @@} are
recognized.  The conversion is case-insensitive, so @code{A} and
@code{a} are the same digit.

@cindex &-prefix for decimal numbers
@cindex #-prefix for decimal numbers
@cindex %-prefix for binary numbers
@cindex $-prefix for hexadecimal numbers
@cindex 0x-prefix for hexadecimal numbers
You can make the base explicit for the number by using a prefix:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{#} -- decimal
@item
@code{%} -- binary
@item
@code{$} -- hexadecimal
@item
@code{&} -- decimal (non-standard)
@item
@code{0x} -- hexadecimal, if base<33 (non-standard).
@end itemize

For combinations including base-prefix and sign, the standard order is
to have the base-prefix first (e.g., @code{#-123}); Gforth supports
both orders.

@cindex double-cell numbers, input format
@cindex input format for double-cell numbers
You can put a decimal point @code{.} at the end of a number (or,
non-standardly, anywhere else except before a prefix) to get a
double-cell integer (e.g., @code{#-123.} or @code{#-.123} (the same
number)).

By default (@word{.-is-dcell?} pushes true), prefixless numbers with
a decimal point (e.g., @code{-123.}) are also recognized as
double-cell integers.  This is confusing to users experienced in other
programming language.  To clear up the confusion early, Gforth warns
of such usage; to avoid the warnings, the best approach is to always
write double numbers with a base prefix (e.g., @code{#-123.}).  This
also works in the setting @code{0 to .-is-dcell?}.

Here are some examples, with the equivalent decimal number shown after
in braces:

@code{$-41} (-65), @code{%1001101} (205), @code{%1001.0001} (145, a
double-precision number), @code{#905} (905), @code{$abc} (2478),
@code{$ABC} (2478).

@cindex '-prefix for characters/code points
@cindex input format for characters/code points
You can get the numeric value of a (character) code point by
surrounding the character with @code{'} (e.g., @code{'a'}).  The
trailing @code{'} is required by the standard, but you can leave it
away in Gforth.  Note that this also works for non-ASCII characters.
For many uses, it is more useful to have the character as a string
rather than as a cell; see below for the string syntax.

@node Floating-point number and complex literals, String and environment variable literals, Integer and character literals, Literals in source code
@section Floating-point number and complex literals

@cindex floating-point numbers, input format
@cindex input format for floating-point numbers
For floating-point numbers in Forth, you recognize them due to their
exponent.  I.e., by default @code{1.} is a double-cell integer, and
@code{1e0} is a floating-point number; the latter can be (and usually
is) shortened to @code{1e}.  Both the significand (the part before the
@code{e} or @code{E}) and the exponent may have signs (including
@code{+}); the significand must contain at least one digit and may
contain a decimal point, the exponent can be empty.  Floating-point
numbers always use decimal base for both significand and exponent, and
are only recognized when the base is decimal.  Examples are: @code{1e
1e0 1.e 1.e0 +1e+0} (which all represent the same number)
@code{+12.E-4}.

With the setting @code{0 to .-is-dcell?}, Gforth (since 1.0) does not
recognize prefixless numbers with a decimal point as double-cell
integers, but recognizes them as FP numbers instead.  Note that
standard Forth systems (such as the default setting of Gforth) behave
differently, so we recommend always using @code{e} to signify FP
numbers.

A Gforth extension (since 1.0) is to write a floating-point number in
scaled notation: It can optionally have a sign, then one or more
digits, then use one of the mostly SI-defined scaling symbols (aka
metric prefixes) or @code{%}, and then optionally more digits.  Here's
the full list of scaling symbols that Gforth accepts:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{Q} @code{e30}  quetta 
@item                
@code{R} @code{e27}  ronna

@code{P} @code{e15}  peta   
@item

@code{h} @code{e2}   hecto  
@item                
@code{d} @code{e-1}  deci   
@item                
@code{%} @code{e-2}  percent (not @code{c})
@item                
@code{m} @code{e-3}  milli  
@item                
@code{u} @code{e-6}  micro   (not @code{μ})
@item                
@code{n} @code{e-9}  nano   
@item                
@code{p} @code{e-12} pico   
@item                
@code{f} @code{e-15} femto  
@item                
@code{a} @code{e-18} atto   
@item                
@code{z} @code{e-21} zepto  
@item                
@code{y} @code{e-24} yocto  
@item                
@code{r} @code{e-27} ronto  
@item                
@code{q} @code{e-30} quecto 
@end itemize

Unlike most of the rest of Gforth, scaling symbols are treated
case-sensitively.  Using the scaled notation is equivalent to using a
decimal point instead of the scaling symbol and appending the
exponential notation at the end.  Examples of scaled notation:
@code{6k5} (6500e) @code{23%} (0.23e).

@cindex complex numbers, input format
In Gforth (since 1.0) you can input a complex number with
@code{@i{real}+@i{imaginary}i}, where both @code{@i{real}} and
@code{@i{imaginary}} are strings that are recognized as floating-point
numbers.  E.g., @code{1e+2ei}.  This pushes the values @code{1e} and
@code{2e} on the floating-point stack, so one might just as well have
written @code{1e 2e}, but @code{1e+2ei} makes the intent obvious.

@node String and environment variable literals, Literals for tokens and addresses, Floating-point number and complex literals, Literals in source code
@section String and environment variable literals

@cindex String input format
@cindex input format for strings
In Gforth (since 1.0) you can input a string by surrounding it with
@code{"} (e.g. @code{"abc"}, @code{"a b"}).  The result is the
starting address and byte (=char) count of the string on the data
stack.

You have to escape any @code{"} inside the string with @code{\} (e.g.,
@code{"double-quote->\"<-"}).  In addition, this string syntax
supports all the ways to write control characters that are supported
by @code{s\"} (@pxref{String and character literals}).  A disadvantage
of this string syntax is that it is non-standard; for standard
programs, use @code{s\"} instead.

@cindex environment variable input format
@cindex input format for environment variables
In Gforth (since 1.0) you can input an environment variable by
surrounding its name with @code{$@{}...@code{@}}, e.g.,
@code{$@{HOME@}}; the result is a string descriptor on the data stack
in the format described above.  This is equivalent to @code{"HOME"
getenv}, i.e., the environment variable is resolved at run-time.

@node Literals for tokens and addresses, Disambiguating recognizers, String and environment variable literals, Literals in source code
@section Literals for tokens and addresses

Gforth (since 1.0) also recognizes the following literals:

@cindex xt input format
@cindex execution token input format
@cindex input format for execution tokens
@cindex @code{`} prefix of word
You can input an execution token (xt) of a word by prefixing the name
of the word with the backquote @code{`} (e.g., @code{`dup}).  An
advantage over using @code{'} or @code{[']} is you do not need to
switch between them when copying and pasting code from inside to
outside a colon definition or vice versa.  A disadvantage is that this
syntax is non-standard.

@cindex nt input format
@cindex nt token input format
@cindex input format for name tokens
@cindex @code{``} prefix of word
You can input a name token (nt) of a word by prefixing the name of the
word with @code{``} (e.g., @code{``dup}).  This syntax is also
non-standard.

@cindex body-relative address input format
@cindex input format for body-relative addresses
You can input a body address of a word by surrounding it with @code{<}
and @code{>} (e.g., @code{<spaces>}).  You can also input an address
that is at a positive offset from the body address (typically an
address in that body), by putting @code{+} and a number (see syntax
above) between the word name and the closing @code{>} (e.g.,
@code{<spaces+$15>}, @code{<spaces+-3>}).  You will get the body address
plus the number.  This feature exists to allow copying
and pasting the output of @code{...} (@pxref{Examining data}).

In addition, by default Gforth recognizes words with @code{rec-name} and
@code{rec-scope}, and stores in or adds to value-flavoured words with
@code{rec-to}, but these do not recognize literals, so they are
discussed elsewhere (@pxref{Default recognizers}).

@node Disambiguating recognizers,  , Literals for tokens and addresses, Literals in source code
@section Disambiguating recognizers

@cindex meta recognizer
In some cases where two recognizers match the same string, you can
specify in Gforth (since 1.0) which recognizer you want to use, with
@code{@i{recognizer}?@i{string}}, where @code{@i{recognizer}} is the
name of the recognizer without the @code{rec-} prefix, and
@code{@i{string}} is the string you want to recognize.  E.g.,
@code{float?1.} uses @code{rec-float} to recognize a string that would
otherwise be recognized as a double-cell integer number (because
@code{rec-number} is earlier in the recognizer sequence than
@code{rec-float}).

@section Notation
@cindex notation of glossary entries
@cindex format of glossary entries
@cindex glossary notation format
@cindex word glossary entry format

The Forth words are described in this section in the glossary notation
that has become a de-facto standard for Forth texts:

@format
@i{word}     @i{Stack effect}   @i{wordset}   @i{pronunciation}
@end format
@i{Description}

@table @var
@item word
The name of the word.

@item Stack effect
@cindex stack effect
The stack effect is written in the notation @code{@i{before} --
@i{after}}, where @i{before} and @i{after} describe the top of
stack entries before and after the execution of the word. The rest of
the stack is not touched by the word. The top of stack is rightmost,
i.e., a stack sequence is written as it is typed in.

Gforth has several stacks, in particular, the data stack, return stack
and floating-point stack.  However, it uses a unified stack effect
notation, where one stack effect description describes all three stack
effects, and the name of the item indicates which stack the item is
on: floating-point stack items start with @i{r}.  Return stack items
are prefixed with @i{R:}, but are otherwise the same as data stack
items.  E.g., in the stack effect @code{( @i{w1 w2} -- @i{R:w1 R:w2}
)} @i{w1} is a cell on the data stack, and @i{R:w1} is a cell on the
return stack with the same value.  So a unified stack effect

@example
( @i{r1 n1 R:n2} -- @i{R:n3 n4 r2} )
@end example

is equivalent to the separated stack effect notation

@example
( @i{n1} -- @i{n4} ) ( R: @i{n2} -- @i{n3} ) ( F: @i{r1} -- @i{r2} )
@end example

The name of a stack item describes the type and/or the function of the
item. See below for a discussion of the types.

Words generally have different stack effects in different contexts.
If only one stack effect is shown, it's the stack effect for the
execution/interpretation semantics.@footnote{Gforth 1.0 does not make
a difference between interpretation and execution semantics.}  The
stack effect of default compilation semantics is @code{( -- )} and is
not shown.

The stack-effects of non-default compilation semantics are shown if
they are other than @code{( -- )}.  Such words usually also have a
run-time semantics, and their stack effects are then shown as in this
example

@example
; ( compilation @i{colon-sys} -- ; run-time @i{nest-sys} -- )
@end example

Further stack effects, such as those of defined words, of passed
xts, are shown in the description part of the glossary entry.

Also note that in code templates or examples there can be comments in
parentheses that display the stack picture at this point; there is no
@code{--} in these places, because there is no before-after
situation.

@cindex pronunciation of words
@item pronunciation
How the word is pronounced.

@cindex wordset
@cindex environment wordset
@item wordset
The wordset specifies if a word has been standardized (indicated by a
capitalized wordset name), it is an environmental query string
(indicated by ``environment''), or if it is a Gforth-specific word
(lower case).

The Forth standard is divided into several word sets. In theory, a
standard system need not support all of them, but in practice, serious
systems on non-tiny machines support almost all standardized words
(some systems require explicit loading of some word sets, however), so
it does not increase portability in practice to be parsimonious in
using word sets.

For the Gforth-specific words, we have the following categories:

@table @code
@item gforth
@item gforth-@i{<version>}
We intend to permanently support this word in Gforth and it has been
available since Gforth @i{<version>} (possibly not as stable word at
that time).

You see @code{gforth} in the source code (e.g., when using
@code{locate}), and @code{gforth-@i{<version>}} in the documentation
(e.g., when using @code{help}).  So if you want to know since which
Gforth version a word is available, use @code{help @i{word}}.

@item @i{library}
The word belongs to a library that is independent of Gforth, but is
delivered with Gforth and documented in this manual.  Gforth 1.0
includes libraries with the following wordset names:
mini-oof
mini-oof2
minos2
minos2-bidi
objects
oof
regexp-cg
regexp-pattern
regexp-replace
cilk

@item gforth-experimental
This word is available in the present version and may turn into a
stable word or may be removed in a future release of Gforth.
Feedback welcome.

@item gforth-internal
This word is an internal factor, not a supported word, and it may be
removed in a future release of Gforth.  If you see a word in the
source code (e.g., with @code{locate}) without a wordset, that word is
also an internal factor.

@item gforth-obsolete
This word will be removed in a future release of Gforth.

@node Case insensitivity, Comments, Notation, Words
@section Case insensitivity
@cindex case sensitivity
@cindex upper and lower case

Gforth is case-insensitive for ASCII characters and case-sensitive
for non-ASCII characters.  I.e., you can invoke Standard words using
upper, lower or mixed case.

For now, Standard Forth only @i{requires} implementations to recognise
Standard words when they are typed entirely in upper case.  You can
use whatever case you like for words that you define, but in a
Standard program you have to use the words in the same case that you
defined them.

Gforth supports case sensitivity through @code{cs-wordlist}s (case-sensitive
wordlists, @pxref{Word Lists}).

@c does not work in 0.7.9_20240821
@c Two people have asked how to convert Gforth to be case-sensitive; while
@c we think this is a bad idea, you can change all wordlists into tables
@c like this:
@c 
@c @source
@c ' table-find forth-wordlist wordlist-map @ !
@c @end source
@c 
@c Note that you now have to type the predefined words in the same case
@c that we defined them, which are varying.  You may want to convert them
@c to your favourite case before doing this operation (I won't explain how,
@c because if you are even contemplating doing this, you'd better have
@c enough knowledge of Forth systems to know this already).

@section Comments
@cindex comments

Forth supports two styles of comment; the @i{in-line} comment starting
with @code{(} and ending with @code{)}, and the comment to the end of
the line line starting with @code{\}.  Don't forget the space after
the starting word.

zero if you are lucky. The operator is written after the operands, but
the operands are still in the original order. I.e., the infix
@code{2-1} corresponds to @code{2 1 -}.

@c !! cell undefined
By default, numbers in Forth are single-precision integers that are
one cell (a machine word, e.g., 64 bits on a 64-bit system) in
size. They can be signed or unsigned, depending upon how you treat
them. For the rules used by the text interpreter for recognising
single-precision integers see @ref{Literals}.

@code{+}, @code{1+}, @code{under+}, @code{-}, @code{1-}, @code{*} are
defined for signed operands, but they also work for unsigned numbers.

@subsection Double precision
@cindex double precision arithmetic words

For the rules used by the text interpreter for
recognising double-precision integers, see @ref{Literals}.

A double precision number is represented by a cell pair, with the most
significant cell at the top-of-stack (TOS). It is trivial to convert
an unsigned single to a double: simply push a @code{0} onto the
TOS. Numbers are represented by Gforth using 2's complement
arithmetic, so converting a signed single to a (signed) double
requires sign-extension across the most significant cell. This can be
achieved using @code{s>d}. You cannot convert a number from
single-cell to double-cell without knowing whether it represents an
unsigned or a signed number.  By contrast, in 2's complement
arithmetic the conversion from double to single just @code{drop}s the
most significant cell, and @code{d>s} just documents the intent.

@code{D+} and @code{d-} are defined for signed operands, but also work
for unsigned numbers.

@cindex Division by zero
@cindex Result out of range

Below you find a considerable number of words for dealing with
divisions.  A major difference between them is in dealing with signed
division: Do the words support signed division? Those with the
@code{u} prefix do not.

@cindex floored division
@cindex symmetric division
Do signed division words round towards negative infinity (floored
division, suffix @code{F}), or towards 0 (symmetric division, suffix
@code{S}).  The standard leaves the issue implementation-defined for
most standard words (@code{/ mod /mod */ */mod m*/}).  Gforth
implements these words as floored (since Gforth 0.7), but there are
systems that implement them as symmetric.  There is only a difference
between floored and symmetric division if the dividend and the divisor
have different signs, and the dividend is not a multiple of the
divisor.  The following table illustrates the results:

@example

@end example

The common case where floored vs.@: symmetric makes a difference is when
dividends n1 with varying sign are divided by the same positive
divisor n2; in that case you usually want floored division, because
then the remainder is always positive and does not change sign
depending on the dividend; also, with floored division, the quotient
always increases by 1 when n1 increases by n2, while with symmetric
division there is no increase in the quotient for -n2<n1<n2 (the
quotient is 0 in this range).

In any case, if you divide numbers where floored vs.@: symmetric makes a
difference, you should think about which variant is the right one for
you, and then use either the appropriately suffixed Gforth words, or
the standard words @code{fm/mod} or @code{sm/rem}.

In the following, ``remainder'' (symmetric) has the same sign as the
dividend or is 0, while ``modulus'' (floored) has the same sign as the
divisor or is 0.

The following words perform single-by-single-cell division:

doc-/
doc-/s
doc-/f
doc-u/
doc-mod
doc-mods
doc-modf
doc-umod
doc-/mod
doc-/mods
doc-/modf
doc-u/mod

The following words perform double-by-single-cell division with
single-cell results; these words are roughly as fast as the words
above on some architectures (e.g., AMD64), but much slower on others
(e.g., an order of magnitude on various ARM A64 CPUs).

doc-fm/mod
doc-sm/rem
doc-um/mod
doc-du/mod
doc-*/
doc-*/s
doc-*/f
doc-u*/
doc-*/mod
doc-*/mods
doc-*/modf
doc-u*/mod

The following words perform division with double-cell results; these
words are much slower than the words above.

doc-ud/mod
doc-m*/

You can use the environmental query @code{floored}
(@pxref{Environmental Queries}) to learn whether @code{/ mod /mod */
*/mod m*/} use floored or symmetric division on the system your
program is being loaded on; alternatively, @code{-1 3 /} also produces
-1 on floored and 0 on symmetric systems.

@cindex Floating-point unidentified fault (on integer division)
@cindex Division by zero
@cindex Result out of range (on integer division)
One other aspect of the integer division words is that most of them
can overflow, and division by zero is mathematically undefined.  What
happens if you hit one of these conditions depends on the engine, the
hardware, and the operating system: The engine @code{gforth} tries
hard to throw the appropriate error -10 (Division by zero) or -11
(Result out of range), but on some platforms throws -55
(Floating-point unidentified fault).  The engine @code{gforth-fast}
may produce an inappropriate throw code (and error message), or may
produce no error, just produce a bogus value.  I.e., you should not
bet on such conditions being thrown, but for quicker debugging
@code{gforth} catches more and produces more accurate errors than
@code{gforth-fast}.


@node Two-stage integer division, Bitwise operations, Integer division, Arithmetic
@subsection Two-stage integer division
@cindex dividing many integers with the same divisor
@cindex reciprocal of integer

On most hardware, multiplication is significantly faster than
division.  So if you have to divide many numbers by the same divisor,
it is usually faster to determine the reciprocal of the divisor once
and multiply the numbers with the reciprocal.  If you divide by a
constant, Gforth performs this optimization automatically.

However, for cases where the divisor is not known during compilation,
Gforth provides words that allow you to implement this optimization
without to much fuss.

Let's start with an example: You want to divide all elements of an
array of cells by the same number n.  A straightforward way to
implement this is:

@example
: array/ ( addr u n -- )
  -rot cells bounds u+do
    i @@ over / i !
  1 cells +loop
  drop ;
@end example

A possibly more efficient version looks like this:

@example
: array/ ( addr u n -- )
  @{: | reci[ staged/-size ] :@}
  reci[ /f-stage1m
  cells bounds u+do
    i @@ reci[ /f-stage2m i !
  1 cells +loop ;
@end example

This example first creates a local buffer @code{reci[} with size
@code{staged/-size} for storing the reciprocal data.  Then
@code{/f-stage1m} computes the reciprocal of @i{n} and stores it in
@code{reci[}.  Finally, inside the loop @code{/f-stage2m} uses the
data in @code{reci[} to compute the quotient.

There are some limitations: Only positive divisors are supported for
@code{/f-stage1m}; for @code{u/-stage1m} you can use a divisor of 2 or
higher.  You get an error if you try to use an unsupported divisor.
You must initialize the reciprocal buffer for the floored second-stage
words with @code{/f-stage1m} and for the unsigned second-stage words
with @code{u/-stage1m}.  You must not modify the reciprocal buffer
between the first stage and the second stage; basically, don't treat
it as a memory buffer, but as something that is only mutable by the
first stage; the point of this rule is that future versions of Gforth
will not consider aliasing of this buffer.

@c measurements with bench/stagediv.fs in 0.7.9_20240821
Measurements show that staged division is not always beneficial:

@example
break  100 elem 
even   speedup  core
  7      2.09   Skylake (Core i5-6600K)
  -      0.94   Rocket Lake (Xeon E-2388G)
 40      1.09   Golden Cove (Core i3-1315U P-core)
  -      0.85   Gracemont (Core i3-1315U E-core)
  6      1.68   Zen2 (Ryzen 9 3900X)
  -      0.56   Zen3 (Ryzen 7 5800X)
@end example

The words are:

doc-staged/-size
doc-/f-stage1m
doc-/f-stage2m
doc-modf-stage2m
doc-/modf-stage2m
doc-u/-stage1m
doc-u/-stage2m
doc-umod-stage2m
doc-u/mod-stage2m

Gforth currently does not support staged symmetrical division.

You can recover the divisor from (the address of) a reciprocal with
@code{staged/-divisor @@}:

doc-staged/-divisor

This can be useful when looking at the decompiler output of Gforth: a
division by a constant is often compiled to a literal containing the
address of a reciprocal followed by a second-stage word.

The performance impact of using these words strongly depends on the
architecture (does it have hardware division?) and the specific
implementation (how fast is hardware division?), but just to give you
an idea about the relative performance of these words, here are the
cycles per iteration of a microbenchmark (which performs the mentioned
word once per iteration) on two AMD64 implementations; the @i{norm}
column shows the normal division word (e.g., @code{u/}), while the
@i{stg2} column shows the corresponding stage2 word (e.g.,
@code{u/-stage2m}):

@example
 Skylake              Zen2
norm stg2           norm stg2

@cindex return stack and locals
@cindex locals and return stack

The return stack primarily exists for storing system data, such as
return addresses and loop control parameters, but Forth also allows
programmers to make use of it, albeit with restrictions stemming from
the other uses.  The primary use is for temporary storage of data;
locals also provide this capability, and usually in a more convenient
way; some purists (or puritans) prefer to avoid locals, though.

In Gforth 1.0 you can use the return stack during text interpretation
(and you cannot use locals for that).  The only limitation here is
that you cannot pass data on the return stack into or out of an
included file, block, or @code{evaluate}d string.  Example:

@example
1 >r
: foo [ r> ] literal ;
foo . \ prints 1
@end example

This interpretive usage of return-stack words is non-standard, and
many other Forth systems do not have support this usage, or limit it
to within one line.

In Gforth you can use the return stack for storing data while you also
keep and access data in locals.  However, the standard puts
restrictions on mixing return stack and locals usage, for easy locals
implementations, and there are systems that actually rely on these
restrictions. So, if you want to produce a standard compliant program
and you are using local variables in a definition, forget about return
stack manipulations in that word (refer to the standard document for
the exact rules).

garbage collector}.

@node Memory model, Dictionary allocation, Memory, Memory
@subsection Memory model

@c The Standard Forth description is a mess (e.g., is the heap part of
@c the dictionary?), so let's not stick to closely with it.

@cindex data space
@cindex code space
@cindex name space
Standard Forth considers a Forth system as consisting of several
address spaces, of which only @dfn{data space} is managed and
accessible with the memory words in standard programs.  Memory not
necessarily in data space includes the stacks, the code (called code
space) and the headers (called name space).  Gforth allows at least
read access to all these logical spaces, but does not guarantee that
code accessing the stacks, the threaded or native code, or the headers
is portable or will work in the next Gforth version; Gforth provides
some accessor words for these purposes, however.

@cindex heap memory
@cindex dictionary memory
Another division of memory is between dictionary and heap
memory.@footnote{The term @dfn{dictionary} is also used to refer to
the search data structure embodied in word lists and headers.  The
search data (word headers) reside in dictionary memory.}  In heap
memory you can free allocations in arbitrary order, but you cannot
grow allocations in-place (@pxref{Heap Allocation}).  In dictionary
memory deallocation is impractical for the most part, but you can grow
allocations in place (@pxref{Dictionary allocation}).  Gforth (since
1.0) allows having several sections of dictionary memory in order to
allow more flexibility in this growing (@pxref{Sections}).

@cindex contiguous region
One relevant concept in this context is the @i{contiguous region}: It
means a piece of memory that is contiguous, without any system data
interleaved with it.  In heap memory each allocation forms one
contiguous region, and separate allocations are not contiguous with
any other allocations.  In dictionary memory all allocations in a
section are contiguous, unless something happens that ends the
contiguous region; a typical reason for ending a contiguous region is
defining a word in that section.

@cindex flat address space
@cindex dictionary allocation direction
Gforth provides one big address space, and address arithmetic can be
performed between any addresses. However, in the dictionary headers or
code are interleaved with data, so almost the only contiguous regions
are those described by Standard Forth as contiguous; but you can be
sure that, within a section the dictionary is allocated towards
increasing addresses even between contiguous regions.  The memory
order of allocations in the heap is platform-dependent (and possibly
different from one run to the next).


@node Dictionary allocation, Sections, Memory model, Memory
@subsection Dictionary allocation
@cindex reserving data space
@cindex data space - reserving some

Dictionary allocation is a stack-oriented allocation scheme, i.e., if
you want to deallocate X, you also deallocate everything
allocated after X.

@cindex contiguous regions in dictionary allocation
The allocations using the words below are contiguous and grow the
region towards increasing addresses.  Other words that allocate
dictionary memory of any kind (i.e., defining words including
@code{:noname}) in the same section end the contiguous region and
start a new one, but allocating memory in a different section does not
end a contiguous region.

In Standard Forth only @code{create}d words are guaranteed to produce an
address that is the start of the following contiguous region.  In
particular, the cell allocated by @code{variable} is not guaranteed to
be contiguous with following @code{allot}ed memory.

You can deallocate memory by using @code{allot} with a negative argument
(with some restrictions, see @code{allot}). For larger deallocations use
@code{marker}.

doc-save-mem-dict

Memory accesses have to be aligned (@pxref{Address arithmetic}). So of
course you should allocate memory in an aligned way, too. I.e., before
allocating a cell, @code{here} must be cell-aligned, etc.
The words below align @code{here} if it is not already.  Basically it is
only already aligned for a type, if the last allocation was a multiple
of the size of this type and if @code{here} was aligned for this type
before.

After freshly @code{create}ing a word, @code{here} is @code{align}ed in
Standard Forth (@code{maxalign}ed in Gforth).

@node Sections, Heap Allocation, Dictionary allocation, Memory
@subsection Sections
@cindex sections and contiguous regions
@cindex contiguous regioons and sections

If you want to do something that allocates memory from the dictionary
or compiles code in the middle of a contiguous region of another
dictionary allocation, or in the middle of a colon definition, that's
not possible with a single dictionary pointer, leading to complicated
workarounds.

Gforth provides dictionary sections to address this problem.  Each
section has its own dictionary pointer, and allocating or compiling
something in one section does not interrupt the contiguity of
allocations in other sections.  In this respect Gforth's sections are
similar to sections and segments in assembly languages.

One difference is that the most common usage of sections is as a stack
of sections, which is useful for building nested definitions or
dictionary-allocated data structures: Use @code{next-section} for the
inner definition or data structure, switch back with
@code{previous-section}.

Words like @code{latest} (@pxref{Name token}) and @code{latestxt}
(@pxref{Anonymous Definitions}) refer to the most recent definition in
the current section.  Quotations (@pxref{Quotations}) and the implicit
quotation of @code{does>} (@pxref{User-defined defining words using
CREATE}) are in a different section than the containing definition, so
after the quotation ends (and the section is switched back), words
like @code{latest} report the outer definition rather than the
quotation.

An example of such a usage of the section stack is:

@example
create my2x2matrix
  next-section here 1 , 2 , previous-section ,
  next-section here 3 , 4 , previous-section ,

\ now print my2x2matrix[0,1], i.e., "2":
my2x2matrix 0 cells + @@ 1 cells + @@ .
@end example


This works also for allocating section memory while compiling a
definition, or defining a definition during a contiguous region, e.g.:

@example
create mydispatchtable
  next-section :noname ." foo" ; previous-section ,
  next-section :noname ." bar" ; previous-section ,

\ now dispatch mydispatchtable[1]
mydispatchtable 1 cells + @@ execute
@end example

Note that the interpretation semantics of @code{[:}
(@pxref{Quotations}) switches to the next section internally, so you
can write @code{mydispatchtable} also as follows:
  
@example
create mydispatchtable
  [: ." foo" ;] ,
  [: ." bar" ;] ,
@end example

The interpretation semantics of @code{does>} uses a separate section,
so the @code{does>} does not end the contiguous region, and you can
define a word @code{mydispatch} that includes the dispatch code, as
follows:

@example
create mydispatch
does> ( u -- )
    ( u addr ) swap cells + @@ execute ;
  [: ." foo" ;] ,
  [: ." bar" ;] ,

1 mydispatch \ prints "bar"
@end example

doc-next-section
doc-previous-section

The bottom section in the section stack has the size given with the
@code{--dictionary-size} command-line parameter (@pxref{Invoking
Gforth}).

In addition to the stack of anonymous sections you can also have named
sections that you define with:

doc-extra-section

As an example, here's a variant of the @code{my2x2matrix} definition:

@example
4 cells extra-section myvec

create my2x2matrix
  ' here myvec 1 ' , myvec 2 ' , myvec ,
  ' here myvec 3 ' , myvec 4 ' , myvec ,
@end example

Currently a named section does not start a dictionary stack, and using
@code{next-section} inside a named section throws an error.

You can show the existing sections with:

doc-.sections

At the time of this writing this outputs:

@example
            start      size      used name
    $7F9A5A516000     32768        96 noname

    $7F9A5A51F000     20480      1448 locals-headers
@end example

The lines describe the different sections: First the section stack,
with sections called @code{noname} and (the bottom) @code{Forth}, then
the extra-sections.  The columns are the start address of the section,
the gross size (including section management overhead), how much of

@cindex contiguous regions and heap allocation
Heap allocation supports deallocation of allocated memory in any
order. It does not affect dictionary allocation (i.e., heap allocation
does not end a contiguous region). In Gforth, these words are
implemented using the standard C library calls malloc(), free() and
realloc().

The memory region produced by one invocation of @code{allocate} or
@code{resize} is internally contiguous.  There is no contiguity between
such a region and any other region (including others allocated from the
heap).

Additional words for dealing with memory blocks are described in

the $tring words (@pxref{$tring words}).

Usage example:

@example

@node Growable memory buffers,  , Memory blocks and heap allocation, Heap Allocation
@subsubsection Growable memory buffers

The following words are useful for growable memory buffers.  One can
alternatively use $trings (@pxref{$tring words}), and the differences
are: When the used memory in the buffer shrinks, $trings may resize
the buffer, while @code{adjust-buffer} does not, which may be
preferable for a buffer that is reused all the time.  However, $strings
have one cell less memory overhead, and for longer-term storage the
shrinking may be worthwhile.


doc-buffer%
doc-init-buffer
doc-adjust-buffer

You can get the current address and length of such a buffer with
@code{2@@}.

Typical usage:

@example
create mybuf  buffer% %allot  mybuf init-buffer

@subsection Special Memory Accesses
@cindex byte order
@cindex big-endian
@cindex little-endian
@cindex sign extension
@cindex unaligned memory access

This section is about memory accesses useful for communicating with
other software or other computers.  This means that the accesses are
of a certain bit width (independent of Gforth's cell width), are
possibly not naturally aligned and typically have a certain byte order
that may be different from the native byte order of the system that
Gforth runs on.

We use the following prefixes:

@table @code
@item c
8 bits (character)
@item w
16 bits
@item l
32 bits
@item x
64 bits represented as one cell
@item xd
64 bits represented as two cells
@end table

The @code{x}-prefix words do not work properly on 32-bit systems, so
for code that is intended to be portable to 32-bit systems you should
use @code{xd}-prefix words.  Note that @code{xd}-prefix words work on
64-bit systems: there the upper cell is just 0 (for unsigned values)
or a sign extension of the lower cell.

The memory-access words below all work with arbitrarily (un)aligned
addresses (unlike @code{@@}, @code{!}, @code{f@@}, @code{f!}, which
require alignment on some hardware), and use native byte order (like
these words),

doc-w@
doc-w!
doc-l@
doc-l!
doc-x@
doc-x!
doc-xd@
doc-xd!

For accesses with a specific byte order, you have to perform
byte-order adjustment immediately after a fetch (before the
sign-extension), or immediately before the store.  The results of these
byte-order adjustment words are always zero-extended.

doc-wbe
doc-wle
doc-lbe
doc-lle
doc-xbe
doc-xle
doc-xdbe
doc-xdle

For signed fetches with a specific byte order, you have first have to
perform an unsigned fetch and a byte-order correction, and finally use
a sign-extension word:

doc-c>s
doc-w>s
doc-l>s
doc-x>s
doc-xd>s

Overall, this leads to sequences like

@example
w@@ wbe w>s   \ 16-bit unaligned signed big-endian fetch
>r lle r> l! \ 32-bit unaligned little-endian store
@end example

@node Address arithmetic, Memory Blocks, Special Memory Accesses, Memory
@subsection Address arithmetic
@cindex address arithmetic words

Address arithmetic is the foundation on which you can build data
structures like arrays, records (@pxref{Structures}) and objects
(@pxref{Object-oriented Forth}).

Standard Forth does not specify the sizes of the data types. Instead,
it offers a number of words (e.g., @code{cells}) for computing sizes
and doing address arithmetic.

@cindex address unit
@cindex au (address unit)
Address arithmetic is performed in terms of address units (aus); on
most systems the address unit is one byte.  There is also
word-addressed@footnote{In Forth terminology: cell-addressed.}
hardware in some embedded systems, and on these systems the au is one
cell.  Finally, Forth-2012 also supports systems where a char needs
more than one au.  However, the common practice is that @code{1 chars}
produces 1, and this will be standardized in the next release of the
standard.

The basic address arithmetic words are @code{+} and @code{-}.  E.g., if
you have the address of a cell, perform @code{1 cells +}, and you will
have the address of the next cell.

@cindex alignment of addresses for types
Standard Forth also defines words for aligning addresses for specific
types. Some hardware requires that accesses to specific data types
must only occur at specific addresses; e.g., that (4-byte) cells may
only be accessed at addresses divisible by 4. Even if a machine allows
unaligned accesses, it can usually perform aligned accesses faster.

For the performance-conscious: alignment operations are usually only
necessary during the definition of a data structure, not during the
(more frequent) accesses to it.

Standard Forth defines no words for character-aligning addresses, but
given that @code{1 chars}=1 is common practice, that's not a big loss.

@cindex @code{CREATE} and alignment
Standard Forth guarantees that addresses returned by @code{CREATE}d
words are cell-aligned; in addition, Gforth guarantees that these
addresses are aligned for all Forth purposes.@footnote{Some SIMD
extensions of some instruction sets impose more severe alignment
constraints that @code{create} currently does not satisfy.}

Note that the Standard Forth word @code{char} has nothing to do with address
arithmetic.

Memory blocks often represent character strings; For ways of storing
character strings in memory see @ref{String representations}.  For other
string-processing words see @ref{Displaying characters and strings}.

In case you want to write a program that is portable to systems with
@code{1 chars} > 1 (not recommended), you have to note the difference
between words that take a number of aus (e.g., @code{erase}) and words
that take a number of chars (e.g., @code{blank}), and insert
@code{chars} as appropriate.

When copying characters between overlapping memory regions, use

@cindex Characters - chars=bytes, extended characters, user-perceived characters
@cindex character encoding

@c old section name
@anchor{Characters}
A Forth char is a byte.  Forth programs use chars to represent ASCII
characters or other data that fits into a byte.

But the world has moved on since ASCII, and now the dominating
character set is Unicode, and it is supported by Forth in its UTF-8
encoding.  Forth has extended characters (xchars, @pxref{Xchars and
Unicode}) which map to Unicode code points.  An xchar for an Unicode
code point is represented by 1-4 chars in memory, or one cell on the
data stack.

@c https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/
@c https://www.unicode.org/glossary/
@c https://hzget.github.io/programming/basic/grapheme_cluster.html
@c https://dev.to/bbkr/utf-8-grapheme-clusters-42o7
So is an xchar a character (a @dfn{user-perceived character} in
Unicode terms)?  Unfortunately, the writing systems unified by Unicode
are too complex for that idea to work in general; e.g., characters can
be composed of base characters (one code point) modified by
diacritical marks (0 or more additional code points).  So in general a
user-perceived character cannot be represented by a single cell.
So the way to go is to represent text (including a single
user-perceived characer) as string.

Once you embrace the idea of working with strings instead of with
characters, you find out that you rarely need to deal with individual
code points, and therefore rarely need to use words from the xchar
words (@pxref{Xchars and Unicode}).  Also, given that a string
consists of bytes aka chars, you can use the words that deal with
chars to work on strings containing Unicode characters.  In Unicode
terms: the strings are processed on the level of code units (bytes for
UTF-8), not code points.

You can use the usual integer words on chars and Xchars on the stack.

@cindex ASCII and UTF-8
@cindex UTF-8 and ASCII
In UTF-8 each ASCII character is encoded as single byte with the same
value as in ASCII.  The same holds true for all other character
encodings supported in Gforth.  So you can use the character words
(e.g., @word{c@}) to deal with ASCII characters.  Only ASCII
characters are represented as single bytes in UTF-8, so this benefit
stops there.  In particular, the Unicode code points 128--255 are
represented by two-byte sequences in UTF-8.

@node String representations, Xchars and Unicode, Strings and Characters, Strings and Characters
@subsection String representations
@cindex strings - see character strings
@cindex character strings - representations
@cindex counted strings

Forth commonly represents strings as cell pair @i{c-addr u} on the
stack; @i{u} is the length of the string in bytes (aka chars), and
@i{c-addr} is the address of the first byte of the string.  Note that
a code point may be represented by a sequence of several chars in the
string (and a user-perceived character may consist of several code
points).  @xref{String words}.

Another string representation is used with the string library of words
containing @code{$} (@pxref{$tring words}).  It uses the address of a
cell-sized string handle to represent the string when its allocation
plays a role, e.g., when appending to the string; this corresponds to
owned strings in Rust.  When only the content of the string is of
interest, the @i{c-addr u} representation for the string is used with
these words, too; the validity of a @i{c-addr u} pair ends when the
underlying string is modified or freed; this corresponds to string
slices in Rust.

A legacy string representation are @dfn{counted strings}, represented
on the stack by @i{c-addr}. The char addressed by @i{c-addr} contains
a character-count, @i{n}, of the string and the string occupies the
subsequent @i{n} char addresses in memory.  Counted strings are
limited to 255 bytes in length.  While counted strings may look
attractive due to needing only one stack item, due to their
limitations we recommend avoiding them, especially as input parameters
of words.  @xref{Counted string words}.


@node Xchars and Unicode, String and character literals, String representations, Strings and Characters
@subsection Xchars and Unicode

An xchar is represented as a single cell on the stack and as a
sequence of one or more chars (as string) in memory.@footnote{Of
course, you can also store the xchar cell in memory, but Gforth has no
words for dealing with sequences of such cells.}

The actual supported xchars depend on the encoding, which is
determined automatically from the environment variable
@code{LC_CTYPE}, @code{LC_ALL}, or @code{LANG} (@pxref{Environment
variables}).  If any of them contains ``UTF-8'' on Gforth startup,
Gforth uses UTF-8 encoding (for Unicode), otherwise it uses
fixed-width 8-bit encoding.  The encoding cannot be changed after
Gforth startup, and if any non-ASCII characters are stored in an
image, the image must be invoked in a way that produces the same
encoding and charset setting.

Any text I/O is expected to happen in the encoding and character set
specified in the environment variables, so if any encoding or
character set conversions are needed, perform them outside Gforth,
with tools such as @command{recode} or @command{iconv}.

The fixed-width 8-bit encoding is used for 8-bit encodings of legacy
character sets, such as ISO Latin-1, ISO Latin-2, or KOI8-R.

Whatever the environment, an xchar corresponds to a code point of the
character set.  In some character sets, each code point represents a
character, but in Unicode a user-perceived character may consist of a
sequence of code points.  Gforth currently provides no facilities for
dealing with user-perceived characters, and dealing with code points
rarely provides any benefit, so the usual way to deal with text is as
strings of chars.

The only thing that's in common between Unicode and all the charsets
for which Gforth supports a fixed-width encoding is ASCII: These
character sets all have the code points 0--127 which have the same
meaning, have the same on-stack representation (a number in the range
0--127), and have the same in-memory representation (a single byte
(aka char) that has a value in the range 0--127).

When using UTF-8 encoding, all other codepoints take more than one
byte/char.  In most cases, you can just treat such characters as
strings in memory and don't need to use the following words, but if
you want to deal with individual codepoints, the following words are
useful.

When using the fixed-width encoding, all other code points take only
one byte, but you can still use the xchar words to access the code
points, and your code will also continue to work when you switch to
UTF-8 encoding.

The xchar words add a few data types:

@itemize

@item
@var{xc} is an extended char (xchar) on the stack. It occupies one
cell, and is a subset of unsigned cell.

@item
@var{xc-addr} is the address of an xchar in memory. Alignment
requirements are the same as @var{c-addr}. The memory representation of an
xchar differs from the stack representation, and depends on the
encoding used. An xchar may use a variable number of chars in memory.

@item
@var{xc-addr} @var{u} is a string (or buffer) of xchars in memory,
starting at @var{xc-addr}, @var{u} chars (i.e., bytes, not xchars)
long.

@subsection String and character literals
@cindex character literals
@cindex string literals
@cindex literals for characters and strings

The nicest way to write a string literal is to write it as
@code{"@i{STRING}"}.  For these kinds of string literals as well as
for @code{s\"} some sequences are not put in the resulting string as
is, but are replaced as shown below.  The sequences are mostly the
same as in C (exceptions noted):

@table @code
@item \a
7 @code{#bell} (alert)
@item \b
8 @code{#bs} (backspace)
@item \e
27 @code{#esc} (escape, not in C99)
@item \f
12 @code{#ff} (form feed)
@item \l
10 @code{#lf} (line feed, not in C)
@item \m
13 10  CR LF (not in C)
@item \n
sequence produced by @code{newline} (in C this produces a LF)
@item \q
34 @code{"} (double quote, not in C)
@item \r
13 @code{#cr} (carriage return)
@item \t
9 @code{#tab} (horizontal tab)
@item \u@i{XXXX}
Unicode code point @i{XXXX} (in hex); auto-merges surrogate pairs (not in Forth-2012 nor C)
@item \U@i{XXXXXXXX}
Unicode code point @i{XXXXXXXX} (in hex, not in Forth-2012 nor C)
@item \v
11 VT (vertical tab)
@item \x@i{XX}
raw byte (not code point) @i{XX} (in hex)
@item \z
0 NUL (not in C)
@item \\
@code{\}
@item \"
@code{"} (the @code{\"} does not terminate the string; not in Forth-2012)
@item \@i{XXX}
raw byte; @i{XXX} is 1-3 octal digits (not in Forth-2012).
@end table

A @code{\} before any other character is reserved.

Note that @code{\x}XX produces raw bytes, while @code{\u}XXXX and
@code{\U}XXXXXXXX produce code points for the current encoding.
E.g., if we use UTF-8 encoding and want to encode @"a (code point
U+00E4), you can write the letter @"a itself, or write @code{\xc3\xa4}
(the UTF-8 bytes for this code point), @code{\u00e4}, or @code{\U000000e4}.

The @code{"@i{STRING}"} syntax is non-standard, so for portability you
may want to use one of the following words:

doc-s\"
doc-s"

All these ways of interpreting strings consume heap memory; normally
you can just live with the string consuming memory until the end of
the Gforth session, but if that is a problem for some reason, you can
@code{free} the string when you no longer need it.  Forth-2012 only
guarantees two buffers of 80 characters each, so in standard programs
you should assume that the string lives only until the next-but-one
@code{s"}.

On the other hand, the compilation semantics of string literals of any
form allocates the string in the dictionary, and you cannot
@code{free} it, and it lives as long as the word it is compiled into
(also in Forth-2012).

Likewise, You can get the code @i{xc} of a character
@i{C} with @code{'@i{C}'}.  This way has been standardized since
Forth-2012.  An older way to get it is to use one of the following
words:

doc-char
doc-[char]

You usually use @code{char} outside and @code{[char]} inside colon
definitions, or you just use @code{'@i{C}'}.

Note that, e.g.,

@example
"C" type
@end example

@noindent
is (slightly) more efficient than

@example
'C' xemit
@end example

@noindent
because the latter converts the code point into a sequence of bytes
and individually @code{emit}s them.  Similarly, dealing with general
characters is usually more efficient when representing them as strings
rather than code points.

There are the following words for producing commonly-used characters
and strings that cannot be produced with @code{S"} or @code{'@i{C}'}:

doc-newline
doc-bl
doc-#tab
doc-#lf
doc-#cr
doc-#ff
doc-#bs
doc-#del
doc-#bell
doc-#esc
doc-#eof

Words that are used for memory blocks are also useful for strings, so
for words that move, copy, and fill strings, see @ref{Memory

@ref{Displaying characters and strings}.

The following words work on previously existing strings:

The following words compare case-insensitively for ASCII characters,
but case-sensitively for non-ASCII characters (like in lookup in
wordlists).

doc-capscompare
doc-capsstring-prefix?
doc-capssearch

The following words create or extend strings on the heap:

doc-s+
doc-append
doc->string-execute
doc-$tmp

One could define @code{s+} using @code{>string-execute}, as follows:

@example
: s+ ( c-addr1 u1 c-addr2 u2 -- c-addr u )
  [: 2swap type type ;] >string-execute ;
@end example
  
For concatenating just two strings @code{>string-execute} is
inefficient, but for concatenating many strings @code{>string-execute}
can be more efficient.

@node $tring words, Internationalization and localization, String words, Strings and Characters
@subsection $tring words
@cindex string words with $

The following string library stores strings in ordinary cell-size
variables (string handles).  These handles contain a pointer to a
cell-counted string allocated from the heap.  The string library
originates from bigFORTH.

Because there is only one permanent reference to the contents (the one
in the handle), the string can be relocated or deleted without
worrying about dangling references; this requires that the programmer
uses references produced by, e.g., @code{$@@} only for temporary
purposes, i.e., these references are not passed out, e.g., as return
values or stored in global memory, and words that may change the
handle are not called while these references exist.

This library is complemented by the cell-pair representation: You use
the $tring words for variable strings which are cumbersome with the
c-addr u representation.  You use the cell-pair representation for
processing (e.g., inspecting) strings while they do not change.

@node Internationalization and localization, Substitute, $tring words, Strings and Characters
@subsection Internationalization and localization

A program may need to communicate with its user in the user's
language, and it may have users with different languages.  We do not
want to produce one version of the program for each language, so we
write one internationalized program that can use localization features
to communicate in the user's language.

Apart from the words mentioned here, you will probably want to use
Unicode to write the localized strings; you probably do not need to
use the xchar words (@pxref{Xchars and Unicode}) in that context, but
they are there if you need them.

Moreover, you may need to put placeholders (e.g., for amounts of
currency) in localized strings that you substitute for the real values
later.  The word @word{substitute} and friends (@pxref{Substitute})
have been designed for that purpose.

The basic idea in an internationalized program is that instead of, e.g.,

@source
." Please enter your name:"
@end source

you write

@source
L" Please enter your name:" locale@ type
@end source

In the following examples, we use the locales defined with

@source
locale: de    \ German (generic)
locale: de_AT \ German (as used in Austria)
locale: de_CH \ German (as used in Switzerland)
locale: de_DE \ German (as used in Germany)
@end source

In addition, there are the locales @word{program} and @word{default}.

You can activate a locale, i.e., make it the current locale, with,
e.g.,

@source
lang:de_AT
@end source

Note that, unlike most Forth words, locales are case-sensitive, so
@word{lang:de_at} would not work.

In the following examples, we use the following code to output
localized strings, after first setting the strings (shown later):

@source
L" Please enter your name:" locale@ cr type
L" cauliflower" locale@ cr type
L" street" locale@ cr type
L" something else" locale@ cr type
L" bank [geography]" locale@ cr type
L" bank [finance]" locale@ cr type
@end source

When the current locale is @word{de_AT}, the output is:

@example
Bitte geben Sie Ihren Namen ein:
Karfiol
Straße
something else
Ufer
Bank
@end example

When the current locale is @word{de_CH}, the output is:

@example
Bitte geben Sie Ihren Namen ein:
Blumenkohl
Strasse
something else
Ufer
Bank
@end example

In the localization data used for this example (see below), most of
these localizations are inherited from the locale @word{de}, with the
only @code{de_AT}-specific localization being ``Karfiol'' and the only
@code{de_CH}-specific localization being ``Strasse''.  There is no
@word{de} and no @word{default} localization for ``something else'',
so the text in the string @code{L" something else"} is used (we always
get that if we use the @word{program} locale).

So there is a sequence of fallbacks for looking up localizations: For
the general locale @code{@i{X}_@i{Y}}, the first fallback is to
@code{@i{X}}, next to @word{default}, and finally to @word{program}.
If the current locale's name contains no underscore, the fallback
sequence starts at @word{default}.

The role of the locale @word{default} is twofold: It is a fallback if
there is no more specific localization (typically, if the localization
is missing), as for ``something else''.  In many cases (as for
``something else'') there is no @word{default} localization, and the
fallback continues to the @word{L"} string.  But in some cases (e.g.,
in @code{L" bank [geography]"} and @code{L" bank [finance]"}) these
strings are too developer-oriented, and we put a user-oriented string
(``bank'' for both) in the @word{default} locale.

So how do we provide the localized string for a given @word{program}
string?  A simple way is to use @word{locale!}, e.g.:

@source
lang:de_AT
"Karfiol" L" cauliflower" locale!
@end source

However, defining localizations for all @word{L"} strings with
@word{locale!} is cumbersome and error-prone (you have to use the
exact same spelling for @word{L"} strings with @word{locale!} as
before @word{locale@} in the code).

A better alternative is to use @word{locale-csv-out} after loading the
program to save all its @word{L"} strings and all the existing
localizations to a CSV (comma-separated values) file.  The first
column of this file contains the @word{L"} strings, the others the
various localizations for that string.  E.g., the CSV file for the
example in this section contains:

@example
"program","default","de","de_AT","de_CH","de_DE"
"bank [finance]","bank","Bank","","",""
"bank [geography]","bank","Ufer","","",""
"Please enter your name:","","Bitte geben Sie Ihren Namen ein:","","",""
"cauliflower","","Blumenkohl","Karfiol","",""
"street","","Straße","","Strasse",""
"something else","","","","",""
@end example

The first line contains the names of the locales.  Many entries contain
empty strings; in that case, there is no localization for the
@word{L"} string for the locale of that column (and @word{locale@}
will use the next fallback that is not empty.

The way to add localizations is to edit the CSV file.  This is not
easy with a simple text editor if there are many columns.  One way to
work around this is to use a spreadsheet program or an editor that has
good CSV support.  Another way is to distribute the localizations
across several files (which is also better for letting several people
work on the localizations at the same time).  E.g., one file cpuld
contain the localizations for @word{de} and its variants, while
another could contain the localizations for @word{fr} (French) and its
variants.

Once a localization has been edited into a CSV file, one can load the
CSV file with @word{locale-csv}.  All the locales mentioned in the CSV
file except @word{program} and @word{default} will be defined
automatically; if you use @word{locale-csv}, do not use
@word{locale:}, at least not for the locales in the CSV file.

@word{L"} produces a @dfn{locale-string identifier} (@dfn{lsid}).  An
lsid is an opaque token that occupies a cell, and it identifies the
@word{L"} string independent of the locale (language or
country-specific language variation).

@node Substitute, Counted string words, Internationalization and localization, Strings and Characters
@subsection Substitute

This is a simple text macro replacement facility; it is particularly
useful for working with localized strings (@pxref{Internationalization
and localization}).  In other contexts, using @word{>string-execute}
(@pxref{String words}) is often easier.

When using @word{substitute}, strings in the form @code{"text%macro%text"} (with an arbitrary number of macros) are processed, and the
macro variables enclosed in @code{'%'} are replaced by their
associated strings.  Two consecutive @code{%} are replaced by one
@code{%}.  Macros are defined in a specific wordlist, and return a
string upon execution; the standard defines only one way to declare
macros, @code{replaces}, which creates a macro that just returns a
string.

@subsection Counted string words

Counted strings store the length as byte at the address pointed to,
followed by the bytes of the string.  Their possible length is
severely limited, and you cannot create a substring in-place without
destroying the input string.  Therefore we recommend against using
counted strings.  Nevertheless, if you have to deal with counted
strings, here are some words for that:

doc-count

The following word has no useful interpretation semantics (unlike
@code{s"}) and no interpretive counterpart (unlike @code{[char]}), so
you should use it only inside colon definitions (if at all):

Control structures in Forth cannot be used interpretively, only in a
colon definition@footnote{To be precise, in Standard Forth the
control-flow words have no interpretation semantics, and in Gforth the
interpretation semantics of the control-flow words are not useful for
interpretive control flow (@pxref{Interpretation and Compilation
Semantics}).}. We do not like this limitation, but have not seen a
satisfying way around it yet, although many schemes have been
proposed.

@cindex @code{IF} control structure
@example
@i{flag} IF
  @i{code}
THEN
@end example
@noindent

If @i{flag} is non-zero (as far as @code{IF} etc. are concerned, a
non-zero cell represents truth), @i{code} is executed.

You may wonder why @code{then} ends an @code{if} construct, which is
at odds with the usage of @code{then} in some other programming
languages, and with the idiom ``if ... then ...'' in English.
According to @cite{Webster's New Encyclopedic Dictionary}, @dfn{then
(adv.)}  has the following meanings:
@quotation
... 2b: following next after in order ... 3d: as a necessary consequence
(if you were there, then you saw them).
@end quotation
Forth's @code{then} has the meaning 2b, whereas @code{THEN} in Pascal
and many other programming languages has the meaning 3d.  If you do
not like this usage of @code{then}, Gforth (but not Standard Forth)
also has @code{endif}, which can be used in its place.  Adding
@code{ENDIF} to a system that only supplies @code{THEN} is simple:
@example
: ENDIF   POSTPONE then ; immediate
@end example

@example
@i{flag} IF
  @i{code1}
ELSE
  @i{code2}
THEN
@end example

If @var{flag} is true, @i{code1} is executed, otherwise @i{code2} is
executed.

Gforth also provides the words @code{?DUP-IF} and @code{?DUP-0=-IF}, so
you can avoid using @code{?dup}. Using these alternatives is also more
efficient than using @code{?dup}. Definitions in Standard Forth
for @code{ENDIF}, @code{?DUP-IF} and @code{?DUP-0=-IF} are provided in
@file{compat/control.fs}.

  ( x ) @i{default-code} ( x )
ENDCASE ( )
@end example

Executes the first @i{codei}, where the @i{xi} is equal to @i{x}.  If no
@i{xi} matches, the optional @i{default-code} is executed. The optional
default case can be added by simply writing the code after the last
@code{ENDOF}. It may use @i{x}, which is on top of the stack, but must
not consume it.  The value @i{x} is consumed by this construction
(either by an @code{OF} that matches, or by the @code{ENDCASE}, if no OF
matches).  Example:

@example
: num-name ( n -- c-addr u )
 case
   0 of s" zero " endof
   1 of s" one "  endof
   2 of s" two "  endof
   \ default case:

   rot \ get n on top so ENDCASE can drop it

@node Counted Loops, General loops with multiple exits, General Loops, Control Structures
@subsection Counted Loops
@cindex counted loops
@cindex loops, counted
@cindex @code{DO} loops

The basic counted loop is:
@example
@i{limit} @i{start} ?DO
  @i{body}
LOOP
@end example

This performs one iteration for every integer, starting from @i{start}
and up to, but excluding @i{limit}. The counter, or @i{index}, can be
accessed with @code{i}. For example, the loop:
@example
10 0 ?DO
  i .
LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}

The index of the innermost loop can be accessed with @code{i}, the index
of the next loop with @code{j}, and the index of the third loop with
@code{k}.

You can access the limit of the innermost loop with @code{i'} and
@code{i'}-@code{i} with @code{delta-i}.  E.g., running

@example
: foo 7 5 ?do cr i . i' . delta-i . loop ; 
@end example

prints

@example
5 7 2 
6 7 1
@end example

The loop control data are kept on the return stack, so there are some
restrictions on mixing return stack accesses and counted loop words. In
particuler, if you put values on the return stack outside the loop, you
cannot read them inside the loop@footnote{Not in a way that is
portable.}. If you put values on the return stack within a loop, you
have to remove them before the end of the loop and before accessing the
index of the loop.

There are several variations on the counted loop:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{LEAVE} leaves the innermost counted loop immediately; execution
continues after the associated @code{LOOP} or @code{NEXT}. For example:

@example
10 0 ?DO  i DUP . 3 = IF LEAVE THEN LOOP
@end example
prints @code{0 1 2 3}


@item
@code{UNLOOP} prepares for an abnormal loop exit, e.g., via
@code{EXIT}. @code{UNLOOP} removes the loop control parameters from the
return stack so @code{EXIT} can get to its return address. For example:

@example
: demo 10 0 ?DO i DUP . 3 = IF UNLOOP EXIT THEN LOOP ." Done" ;
@end example
prints @code{0 1 2 3}


@item
If @i{start} is greater than @i{limit}, a @code{?DO} loop is entered
(and @code{LOOP} iterates until they become equal by wrap-around
arithmetic). This behaviour is usually not what you want. Therefore,
Gforth offers @code{+DO} and @code{U+DO} (as replacements for
@code{?DO}), which do not enter the loop if @i{start} is greater than
@i{limit}; @code{+DO} is for signed loop parameters, @code{U+DO} for
unsigned loop parameters.

@item
@code{?DO} can be replaced by @code{DO}. @code{DO} always enters
the loop, independent of the loop parameters. Do not use @code{DO}, even
if you know that the loop is entered in any case. Such knowledge tends
to become invalid during maintenance of a program, and then the
@code{DO} will make trouble.

@item
@code{LOOP} can be replaced with @code{@i{n} +LOOP}; this updates the
index by @i{n} instead of by 1. The loop is terminated when the border
between @i{limit-1} and @i{limit} is crossed. E.g.:

@example
4 0 +DO  i .  2 +LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 2}

@example
4 1 +DO  i .  2 +LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{1 3}

@item
@cindex negative increment for counted loops
@cindex counted loops with negative increment
The behaviour of @code{@i{n} +LOOP} is peculiar when @i{n} is negative:

@example
-1 0 ?DO  i .  -1 +LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 -1}

@example
0 0 ?DO  i .  -1 +LOOP
@end example
prints nothing.

We recommend not combining @code{?DO} with @code{+LOOP}.  Gforth offers
several alternatives:

If you want @code{-1 +LOOP}'s behaviour of including an iteration
where @code{I}=limit, start the loop with @code{-[DO} or @code{U-[DO}
(where the @code{[} is inspired by the mathematical notation for
inclusive ranges, e.g., [1,n]):

@example
-1 0 -[DO  i .  -1 +LOOP
@end example

prints @code{0 -1}.

@example
0 0 -[DO  i .  -1 +LOOP
@end example

prints @code{0}.

@example
0 -1 -[DO  i .  -1 +LOOP
@end example

prints nothing.

If you want to exclude the limit, you instead use @code{1 -LOOP} (or
generally @code{@i{u} -LOOP}) and start the loop with @code{?DO},
@code{-DO} or @code{U-DO}.  @code{-LOOP} terminates the loop when the
border between @i{limit+1} and @i{limit} is crossed.  E.g.:

@example
-2 0 -DO  i .  1 -LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 -1}

@example
-1 0 -DO  i .  1 -LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0}

@example
0 0 -DO  i .  1 -LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints nothing.

Unfortunately, @code{+DO}, @code{U+DO}, @code{-DO}, @code{U-DO} and
@code{-LOOP} are not defined in Standard Forth. However, an implementation
for these words that uses only standard words is provided in
@file{compat/loops.fs}.

@item
@cindex iterate over array
@cindex array, iterating over
A common task is to iterate over the elements of an array, forwards or
backwards.  Iterating over the addresses of the elements has two
benefits: It avoids the need to keep the start address of the array
around, reducing the data stack load; and it avoids the need to
perform address computations in every iteration.  The disadvantage is
that, starting with the usual array representations @i{addr uelems} or
@i{addr ubytes}, some processing is required to produce a start and
limit address.  Gforth has @code{bounds} for getting there from the
@i{addr ubytes} representation, so you can write a forward loop
through a cell array @code{v} as:

@source
create v 1 , 3 , 7 ,
: foo v 3 cells bounds U+DO i @ . cell +LOOP ;
foo
@end source

which prints @code{1 3 7}.  Preprocessing the inputs for walking
backwards is more involved, so Gforth provide a loop construct of the
form @code{MEM-DO}...@code{LOOP} that does it for you: It takes an
array in @i{addr ubytes} representation and the element size, and
iterates over the addresses of the elements in backwards order:

@source
create v 1 , 3 , 7 ,
: foo1 v 3 cell array>mem MEM-DO i @ . LOOP ;
foo1
@end source

This prints @code{7 3 1}.  @code{ARRAY>MEM} converts the @i{addr
uelems uelemsize} representation into the @i{addr ubytes uelemsize}
representation expected by @code{MEM-DO}.  This loop is finished with
@code{LOOP} which decrements by @i{uelemsize} when it finishes a
@code{MEM-DO}.

Gforth also adds @code{MEM+DO} for completeness.  It takes the same
parameters as @code{MEM-DO}, but walks forwards through the array:

@source
create v 1 , 3 , 7 ,
: foo2 v 3 cell array>mem MEM+DO i @ . LOOP ;
foo2
@end source

prints @code{1 3 7}.

@item
@cindex @code{FOR} loops
Another counted loop is:
@example
@i{n}
FOR
  @i{body}
NEXT
@end example
This is the preferred loop of native code compiler writers who are too
lazy to optimize @code{?DO} loops properly. This loop structure is not
defined in Standard Forth. In Gforth, this loop iterates @i{n+1} times;
@code{i} produces values starting with @i{n} and ending with 0. Other
Forth systems may behave differently, even if they support @code{FOR}
loops. To avoid problems, don't use @code{FOR} loops.

The standard does not allow using @code{CS-PICK} and @code{CS-ROLL} on
@i{do-sys}. Gforth allows it, except for the do-sys produced by
@code{MEM+DO} and @code{MEM-DO}, but it's your job to ensure that for
every @code{?DO} etc. there is exactly one @code{UNLOOP} on any path
through the definition (@code{LOOP} etc. compile an @code{UNLOOP} on
the fall-through path). Also, you have to ensure that all
@code{LEAVE}s are resolved (by using one of the loop-ending words or
@code{DONE}).

@node General loops with multiple exits, General control structures with CASE, Counted Loops, Control Structures
@subsection General loops with multiple exits
@cindex Multiple exits from @code{begin}

For counted loops, you can use @code{leave} in several places.  For
@code{begin} loops, you have the following options:

Use @code{exit} (possibly several times) in the loop to leave not just
the loop, but the whole colon definition.  E.g.,:

@example
: foo
  begin
    condition1 while
      condition2 if
        exit-code2 exit then
      condition3 if
        exit-code3 exit then
    ...
  repeat
  exit-code1 ;
@end example
  
The disadvantage of this approach is that, if you want to have some
common code afterwards, you either have to wrap @code{foo} in another
definition that contains the common code, or you have to call the
common code several times, from each exit-code.

Another approach is to use several @code{while}s in a @code{begin}
loop.  You have to append a @code{then} behind the loop for every
additional @code{while}.  E.g.,;

@example
begin
  condition1 while
    condition2 while
      condition3 while
again then then then
@end example

Here I used @code{again} at the end of the loop so that I would have a
@code{then} for each @code{while}; @code{repeat} would result in one
less @code{then}, but otherwise the same behaviour.  For an
explanation of why this works, @xref{Arbitrary control structures}.

We can have common code afterwards, but, as presented above, we cannot
have different exit-codes for the different exits.  You can have these
different exit-codes, as follows:

@example
begin
  condition1 while
    condition2 while
      condition3 while
again then exit-code3
else exit-code2 then
else exit-code1 then
@end example

This is relatively hard to comprehend, because the exit-codes are
relatively far from the exit conditions (it does not help that we are
not used to such control structures, either).  The following extended
@code{case} does not have this problem.

@node General control structures with CASE, Arbitrary control structures, General loops with multiple exits, Control Structures
@subsection  General control structures with @code{case}
@cindex @code{case} as generalized control structure
@cindex general control structures (@code{case})

Gforth provides an extended @code{case} that solves the problems of
the multi-exit loops discussed above, and offers additional options.
You can find a portable implementation of this extended @code{case} in
@file{compat/caseext.fs}.

There are three additional words in the extension.  The first is
@code{?of} which allows general tests (rather than just testing for
equality) in a @code{case};  e.g.,

@example
: sgn ( n -- -1|0|1 )
  ( n ) case
    dup 0 < ?of drop -1 endof
    dup 0 > ?of drop 1  endof
    \ otherwise leave the 0 on the stack
  0 endcase ;
@end example

Note that @code{endcase} drops a value, which works fine much of the
time with @code{of}, but usually not with @code{?of}, so we leave a 0
on the stack for @code{endcase} to drop.  The n that is passed into
@code{sgn} is also 0 if neither @code{?of} triggers, and that is then
passed out.

The second additional word is @code{next-case}, which allows turning
@code{case} into a loop.  Our triple-exit loop becomes:

@example
case
  condition1 ?of exit-code1 endof
  condition2 ?of exit-code2 endof
  condition3 ?of exit-code3 endof
  ...
next-case
common code afterwards
@end example

As you can see, this solves both problems of the variants discussed
above (@pxref{General loops with multiple exits}).  Note that
@code{next-case} does not drop a value, unlike
@code{endcase}.@footnote{The name @code{next-case} has a @code{-},
unlike the other @code{case} words, because VFX Forth has a
@code{next-case} that works like Gforth's @code{next-case}, but also
contains a @code{nextcase} that drops a value; in VFX you need to pair
@code{next-case} with @code{begincase}, however.}

The last additional word is @code{contof}, which is used instead of
@code{endof} and starts the next iteration instead of leaving the
loop.  This can be used in ways similar to Dijkstra's guarded command
@i{do}, e.g.:

@example
: gcd ( n1 n2 -- n )
    case
        2dup > ?of tuck - contof
        2dup < ?of over - contof
    endcase ;
@end example

Here the two @code{?of}s have different ways of continuing the loop;
when neither @code{?of} triggers, the two numbers are equal and are
the gcd.  @code{Endcase} drops one of them, leaving the other as n.

You can also combine these words.  Here's an example that uses each of
the @code{case} words once, except @code{endcase}:

@example
: collatz ( u -- )
    \ print the 3n+1 sequence starting at u until we reach 1
    case
        dup .
        1 of endof
        dup 1 and ?of 3 * 1+ contof
        2/
    next-case ;
@end example

This example keeps the current value of the sequence on the stack.  If
it is 1, the @code{of} triggers, drops the value, and leaves the
@code{case} structure.  For odd numbers, the @code{?of} triggers,
computes 3n+1, and starts the next iteration with @code{contof}.
Otherwise, if the number is even, it is divided by 2, and the loop is
restarted with @code{next-case}.

The @code{case} words are:

doc-case
doc-endcase
doc-next-case
doc-of
doc-?of
doc-endof
doc-contof

@noindent
Internally, @i{of-sys} is an @code{orig}; and @i{case-sys} is a cell
and some stack-depth information, 0 or more @code{orig}s, and a
@code{dest}.


@node Arbitrary control structures, Calls and returns, General control structures with CASE, Control Structures
@subsection Arbitrary control structures
@cindex control structures, user-defined

@cindex control-flow stack
Standard Forth permits and supports using control structures in a non-nested
way. Information about incomplete control structures is stored on the
control-flow stack. This stack may be implemented on the Forth data
stack, and this is what we have done in Gforth.

@cindex @code{orig}, control-flow stack item
@cindex @code{dest}, control-flow stack item
An @i{orig} entry represents an unresolved forward branch, a @i{dest}
entry represents a backward branch target. A few words are the basis for
building any control structure possible (except control structures that
need storage, like calls, coroutines, and backtracking).


doc-if
doc-ahead
doc-then
doc-begin
doc-until
doc-again
doc-cs-pick
doc-cs-roll
doc-cs-drop

The Standard words @code{cs-pick} and @code{cs-roll} allow you to
manipulate the control-flow stack in a portable way. Without them, you
would need to know how many stack items are occupied by a control-flow
entry (Many systems use one cell. In Gforth they currently take four
cells, but this may change in the future).

When using @code{cs-pick} and @code{cs-drop} on an orig, you need to
use one @code{cs-drop} for every @code{cs-pick} (and vice versa) of a
given orig, because the orig must be resolved by @code{then} exactly
once.

Some standard control structure words are built from these words:

doc-else
doc-while
doc-repeat

@noindent
Gforth adds some more control-structure words:

doc-endif
doc-?dup-if
doc-?dup-0=-if


@node Calls and returns, Exception Handling, Arbitrary control structures, Control Structures
@subsection Calls and returns
@cindex calling a definition
@cindex returning from a definition

@cindex recursive definitions
A definition can be called simply be writing the name of the definition
to be called. Normally a definition is invisible during its own
definition. If you want to write a directly recursive definition, you
can use @code{recursive} to make the current definition visible, or
@code{recurse} to call the current definition directly.


doc-recursive
doc-recurse

@noindent For examples of using these words, @xref{Recursion Tutorial}.

@progstyle
I prefer using @code{recursive} to @code{recurse}, because calling the
definition by name is more descriptive (if the name is well-chosen) than
the somewhat cryptic @code{recurse}.  E.g., in a quicksort
implementation, it is much better to read (and think) ``now sort the
partitions'' than to read ``now do a recursive call''.

For mutual recursion, Gforth offers the defining word @code{forward}.
You can use it to create a forward reference which is resolved
automatically, and does not incur additional costs like the
indirection of @code{Defer}.  However, these forward definitions only
work for colon definitions.  Here's a usage example:

@example
forward foo

: bar ( ... -- ... )
 ... foo ... ;

: foo ( ... -- ... ) \ resolves the forward definition
 ... bar ... ;
@end example

The words used for forward definitions are:

doc-forward
doc-.unresolved

In Standard Forth, you use @code{Defer}red words for mutual recursion,
like this:

@example
Defer foo

: bar ( ... -- ... )
 ... foo ... ;

:noname ( ... -- ... )
 ... bar ... ;
IS foo
@end example

Deferred words are discussed in more detail in @ref{Deferred Words}.

The current definition returns control to the calling definition when
the end of the definition is reached or @code{EXIT} is encountered.

@subsection Exception Handling
@cindex exceptions

@c quit is a very bad idea for error handling, 
@c because it does not translate into a THROW
@c it also does not belong into this chapter

If a word detects an error condition that it cannot handle, it can
@code{throw} an exception.  In the simplest case, this will terminate
your program, and report an appropriate error.

doc-throw
doc-fast-throw

@code{Throw} consumes a cell-sized error number on the stack. There are
some predefined error numbers in Standard Forth (see @file{errors.fs}).  In
Gforth (and most other systems) you can use the iors produced by various
words as error numbers (e.g., a typical use of @code{allocate} is
@code{allocate throw}).  Gforth also provides the word @code{exception}
to define your own error numbers (with decent error reporting); a Standard
Forth version of this word (but without the error messages) is available
in @code{compat/except.fs}.  And finally, you can use your own error
numbers (anything outside the range -4095..0), but won't get nice error
messages, only numbers.  For example, try:

@example
-10 throw                    \ Standard defined
-267 throw                   \ system defined
s" my error" exception throw \ user defined
7 throw                      \ arbitrary number
@end example

doc---exception-exception

There are also cases where you have a word (typically modeled after
POSIX' @code{strerror}) for converting an error number into a string.
You can use the following word to get these strings into Gforth's
error handling:

doc-exceptions

As an example, if the @code{errno} errors (and the conversion using
@code{strerror}) was not already directly supported by Gforth, you
could tie @code{strerror} in as follows:

@example
' strerror 1536 exceptions constant errno-base
: errno-ior ( -- n )
\ n is the Gforth ior corresponding to the value in errno, so
\ we have to convert between the ranges here.
\ ERRNO is not a Gforth word, so you  would have to use the
\ C interface to access it.
  errno errno-base over - swap 0<> and ;
@end example

When you call a C function that can set @code{errno} (with the C
interface, @pxref{C Interface}), you can use one of the following
words for converting that error into a @code{throw}:

doc-?errno-throw
doc-?ior

Which of these you should use depends on how the C function indicates
that an error has happened.  When the system then catches a throw
performed by one of these words, it produces the proper error message
(such as ``Permission denied'').

Note that the errno numbers are not directly used as throw codes
(because the Forth standard specifies that positive throw codes must
not be system-defined), but maps them into a different number range.

A common idiom to @code{THROW} a specific @i{err#} if a
flag is true is this:

@example
@code{( flag ) 0<> @i{err#} and throw}
@end example

Your program can provide exception handlers to catch exceptions.  An
exception handler can be used to correct the problem, or to clean up
some data structures and just throw the exception to the next exception
handler.  Note that @code{throw} jumps to the dynamically innermost
exception handler.  The system's exception handler is outermost, and just
prints an error and restarts command-line interpretation (or, in batch
mode (i.e., while processing the shell command line), leaves Gforth).

The Standard Forth way to catch exceptions is @code{catch}:

doc-catch
doc-catch-nobt
doc-nothrow

The most common use of exception handlers is to clean up the state when
an error happens.  E.g.,

@example
base @@ >r hex \ actually the HEX should be inside foo to protect
              \ against exceptions between HEX and CATCH
['] foo catch ( nerror|0 )
r> base !
( nerror|0 ) throw \ pass it on
@end example

A use of @code{catch} for handling the error @code{myerror} might look
like this:

@example
['] foo catch
CASE
  myerror OF ... ( do something about it ) nothrow ENDOF
  dup throw \ default: pass other errors on, do nothing on non-errors
ENDCASE
@end example

Having to wrap the code into a separate word is often cumbersome,
therefore Gforth provides an alternative syntax:

@example
TRY
  @i{code1}
  IFERROR
    @i{code2}
  THEN
  @i{code3}
ENDTRY
@end example

This performs @i{code1}.  If @i{code1} completes normally, execution
continues with @i{code3}.  If there is an exception in @i{code1} or
before @code{endtry}, the stacks are reset to the depth during
@code{try}, the throw value is pushed on the data stack, and execution
continues at @i{code2}, and finally falls through to @i{code3}.

doc-try
doc-endtry
doc-iferror

If you don't need @i{code2}, you can write @code{restore} instead of
@code{iferror then}:

@example
TRY
  @i{code1}
RESTORE
  @i{code3}
ENDTRY
@end example

@cindex unwind-protect
The cleanup example from above in this syntax:

@example
base @@ @{ oldbase @}
TRY
  hex foo \ now the hex is placed correctly
  0       \ value for throw
RESTORE
  oldbase base !
ENDTRY
throw
@end example

An additional advantage of this variant is that an exception between
@code{restore} and @code{endtry} (e.g., from the user pressing
@kbd{Ctrl-C}) restarts the execution of the code after @code{restore},
so the base will be restored under all circumstances.

However, you have to ensure that this code does not cause an exception
itself, otherwise the @code{iferror}/@code{restore} code will loop.
Moreover, you should also make sure that the stack contents needed by
the @code{iferror}/@code{restore} code exist everywhere between
@code{try} and @code{endtry}; in our example this is achieved by
putting the data in a local before the @code{try} (you cannot use the
return stack because the exception frame (@i{sys1}) is in the way
there).

This kind of usage corresponds to Lisp's @code{unwind-protect}.

@cindex @code{recover} (old Gforth versions)
If you do not want this exception-restarting behaviour, you achieve
this as follows:

@example
TRY
  @i{code1}
ENDTRY-IFERROR
  @i{code2}
THEN
@end example

If there is an exception in @i{code1}, then @i{code2} is executed,
otherwise execution continues behind the @code{then} (or in a possible
@code{else} branch).  This corresponds to the construct

@example
TRY
  @i{code1}
RECOVER
  @i{code2}
ENDTRY
@end example

in Gforth before version 0.7.  So you can directly replace
@code{recover}-using code; however, we recommend that you check if it
would not be better to use one of the other @code{try} variants while
you are at it.

To ease the transition, Gforth provides two compatibility files:
@file{endtry-iferror.fs} provides the @code{try ... endtry-iferror
... then} syntax (but not @code{iferror} or @code{restore}) for old
systems; @file{recover-endtry.fs} provides the @code{try ... recover
... endtry} syntax on new systems, so you can use that file as a
stopgap to run old programs.  Both files work on any Gforth (they just
do nothing if the system already has the syntax it implements), so you
can unconditionally @code{require} one of these files, even if you use
a mix old and new Gforths.

doc-restore
doc-endtry-iferror

Here's the error handling example:

@example
TRY
  foo
ENDTRY-IFERROR
  CASE
    myerror OF ... ( do something about it ) nothrow ENDOF
    throw \ pass other errors on
  ENDCASE
THEN
@end example

@progstyle
As usual, you should ensure that the stack depth is statically known at
the end: either after the @code{throw} for passing on errors, or after
the @code{ENDTRY} (or, if you use @code{catch}, after the end of the
selection construct for handling the error).

There are two alternatives to @code{throw}: @code{Abort"} is conditional
and you can provide an error message.  @code{Abort} just produces an
``Aborted'' error.

The problem with these words is that exception handlers cannot
differentiate between different @code{abort"}s; they just look like
@code{-2 throw} to them (the error message cannot be accessed by
standard programs).  Similarly, @code{abort} looks like @code{-1
throw} to exception handlers.

doc-abort"
doc-abort

For problems that are not that awful that you need to abort execution,
you can just display a warning.  The variable @code{warnings} allows
to tune how many warnings you see.

@node CREATE, Variables, Defining Words, Defining Words
@subsection @code{CREATE}
@cindex simple defining words
@cindex defining words, simple

The simplest defining word is @code{CREATE}, used like this:

@example
CREATE new-word1
@end example

@code{CREATE} is a parsing word, i.e., it takes an argument from the
input stream (@code{new-word1} in our example).  It generates a
dictionary entry for @code{new-word1}. When @code{new-word1} is
executed, all that it does is leave an address on the stack. The
address represents the value of the dictionary pointer (@code{HERE})
at the time that @code{new-word1} was defined. Therefore,
@code{CREATE} is a way of associating a name with the address of a
region of memory.

doc-create

Note that Standard Forth guarantees only for @code{create} that its
body is contiguous with the following dictionary allocations (e.g.,
@code{allot}, @pxref{Dictionary allocation}).  Also, in Standard Forth
only @code{create}d words can be modified with @code{does>}
(@pxref{User-defined Defining Words}).  And in Standard Forth
@code{>body} can only be applied to @code{create}d words.

By extending this example to reserve some memory in data space, we end
up with something like a @i{variable}. Here are two different ways to do
it:

@example
CREATE new-word2 1 cells allot  \ reserve 1 cell without initializing it
CREATE new-word3 4 ,            \ reserve 1 cell and initialise it (to 4)
@end example

The variable can be examined and modified using @code{@@} (``fetch'') and
@code{!} (``store'') like this:

@example
new-word2 @@ .      \ get address, fetch from it and display
1234 new-word2 !   \ new value, get address, store to it
@end example

@cindex arrays
A similar mechanism can be used to create arrays. For example, an
80-character text buffer:

@source
CREATE text-buf 80 allot \ uninitialized

text-buf 0 + c@ \ the 1st character (offset 0)
text-buf 3 + c@ \ the 4th character (offset 3)
@end source

You can build arbitrarily complex data structures by allocating
appropriate areas of memory. For further discussions of this, and to
learn about some Gforth tools that make it easier,
@xref{Structures}.


@node Variables, Constants, CREATE, Defining Words
@subsection Variables
@cindex variables

The previous section showed how a sequence of commands could be used
to generate a variable.  As a final refinement, the whole code
sequence can be wrapped up in a defining word, making it easier to
create new variables:

@example
: myvariableX ( "name" -- a-addr ) CREATE 1 cells allot ;
: myvariable0 ( "name" -- a-addr ) CREATE 0 , ;

myvariableX foo \ variable foo starts off with an unknown value
myvariable0 joe \ whilst joe is initialised to 0

45 3 * foo !   \ set foo to 135
1234 joe !     \ set joe to 1234
3 joe +!       \ increment joe by 3.. to 1237
@end example

Not surprisingly, there is no need to define @code{myvariableX}, since
Forth already has a definition @code{Variable}. Standard Forth does not
guarantee that a @code{Variable} is initialised when it is created
(i.e., it may behave like @code{myvariableX}). In contrast, Gforth's
@code{Variable} initialises the variable to 0 (i.e., it behaves exactly
like @code{myvariable0}). Forth also provides @code{2Variable} and
@code{fvariable} for double and floating-point variables, respectively
-- they are initialised to #0. and 0e in Gforth. If you use a @code{Variable} to
store a boolean, you can use @code{on} and @code{off} to toggle its
state (@pxref{Boolean Flags}).

doc-variable
doc-avariable
doc-2variable
doc-fvariable

Finally, for buffers of arbitrary length there is

doc-buffer:

@comment TODO is that stuff about user variables strictly correct? Is it
@comment just terminal tasks that have user variables?
@comment should document tasker.fs (with some examples) elsewhere
@comment in this manual, then expand on user space and user variables.

@node Constants, Values, Variables, Defining Words
@subsection Constants
@cindex constants

@code{Constant} allows you to declare a fixed value and refer to it by
name. For example:

@example
12 Constant INCHES-PER-FOOT \ is integer appropriate
2.54e fconstant CM-PER-INCH
@end example

A @code{Variable} can be both read and written, so its run-time
behaviour is to supply an address through which its current value can be
manipulated. In contrast, the value of a @code{Constant} cannot be
changed once it has been declared@footnote{Well, often it can be -- but
not in a Standard, portable way. It's safer to use a @code{Value} (read
on).} so it's not necessary to supply the address -- it is more
efficient to return the value of the constant directly. That's exactly
what happens; the run-time effect of a constant is to put its value on
the top of the stack (You can find one
way of implementing @code{Constant} in @ref{User-defined Defining Words}).

Forth also provides @code{2Constant} and @code{fconstant} for defining
double and floating-point constants, respectively.

doc-constant
doc-aconstant
doc-2constant
doc-fconstant



@node Values, Colon Definitions, Constants, Defining Words
@subsection Values
@cindex values

A @code{Value} behaves like a @code{Constant}, but it can be changed.
@code{TO} and @code{+TO} are parsing words that change a value.
Alternatively, you can change a value @code{v} by writing @code{->v}
(equivalent to @code{TO v}) or @code{+>v} (equivalent to @code{+TO
v}).

Here are some
examples:

@example
12 value apples \ Define APPLES with an initial value of 12
34 to apples    \ Change the value of APPLES. TO is a parsing word
34 ->apples     \ Change the value of APPLES. Non-standard usage
1  +to apples   \ Increment APPLES.  Non-standard usage.
1  +>apples     \ Increment APPLES.  Non-standard usage.
apples          \ puts 36 on the top of the stack.
@end example

doc-value
doc-avalue
doc-2value
doc-fvalue
doc-to
doc-+to

@cindex value-flavoured words
@cindex variable-flavoured words
Words that produce their value on execution and that can be changed
with @code{to} or @code{+to} are called value-flavoured (in contrast
to the variable-flavoured words that produce their address on
execution).  They are defined be some of the words listed above, but
also by some locals definitions words (@pxref{Locals definition
words}) and some field definition words (@pxref{Value-Flavoured and
Defer-Flavoured Fields}).

Sometimes you want to take the address of a value-flavoured word.
Because this has some potential performance disadvantages, Gforth asks
you to be explicit about it, and define the word as addressable.  Once
you have done that, you can get the address with @code{addr}.  The
following example is equivalent to the one above:

@source
12 addressable: value apples
34 addr apples ! \ Change the value of APPLES.  ADDR is a parsing word
1 +to apples     \ Increment APPLES
addr apples @    \ puts 35 on the top of the stack.
@end source

doc-addressable:
doc-addr

For now using @code{addr} on a non-@code{addressable:} value results
in a warning.  In the future, when we change the code generation in a
way that results in potentially faster code for
non-@code{addressable:} values, but where the use of @code{addr} on
such values could produce unexpected results, such usage will result
in an error.


@node Colon Definitions, Inline Definitions, Values, Defining Words
@subsection Colon Definitions
@cindex colon definitions

@example
: name ( ... -- ... )
    word1 word2 word3 ;
@end example

@noindent
Creates a word called @code{name} that, upon execution, executes
@code{word1 word2 word3}. @code{name} is a @dfn{(colon) definition}.

The explanation above is somewhat superficial. For simple examples of
colon definitions see @ref{Your first definition}.  For an in-depth
discussion of some of the issues involved, @xref{Interpretation and
Compilation Semantics}.

doc-:

@node Inline Definitions, Anonymous Definitions, Colon Definitions, Defining Words
@subsection Inline Definitions

We plan to to perform automatic inlining eventually, but for now you
can perform inlining with

doc-inline:
doc-;inline

As an example, you can define an inlined word and use it with

@example
inline: my2dup ( a b -- a b a b )
    ]] over over [[ ;inline

#1. my2dup d. d.
: foo my2dup ;
#1. foo d. d.
see foo
@end example

Inline words are related to macros (@pxref{Macros}); the difference is
that a macro has immediate compilation semantics while an
@code{inline:}-defined word has default compilation semantics; this
means that you normally use a macro only inside a colon definition,
while you can use an @code{inline:} word also interpretively.  But
that also means that you can do some things with macros that you
cannot do as an @code{inline:} word.  E.g.,

@example
\ Doesn't work:
\   inline: endif ]] then [[ ;inline
\ Instead, write a macro:
: endif ]] then [[ ; immediate
@end example

Conversely, for words that would be fine as non-immediate colon
definitions, define them as non-immediate colon definitions or (if
utmost performance is required) as @code{inline:} words; don't define
them as macros, because then you cannot properly use them
interpretively:

@example
: another2dup ]] over over [[ ; immediate
\ Doesn't work:
\   #1. another2dup d. d.
@end example

You may wonder why you have to write compiling code between
@code{inline:} and @code{;inline}.  That's because the implementation
of an inline word like @code{my2dup} above works similar to:

@example
: compile-my2dup ( xt -- )
    drop ]] over over [[ ;

: my2dup [ 0 compile-my2dup ] ;
' compile-my2dup set-optimizer
@end example

The @code{DROP} and @code{0} are there because @code{compile-my2dup}
is the implementation of @code{compile,} for @code{my2dup}, and
@code{compile,} expects an xt (@pxref{User-defined compile-comma}).

@node Anonymous Definitions, Quotations, Inline Definitions, Defining Words
@subsection Anonymous Definitions
@cindex colon definitions
@cindex defining words without name

Sometimes you want to define an @dfn{anonymous word}; a word without a
name. You can do this with:

doc-:noname

This leaves the execution token for the word on the stack after the
closing @code{;}. Here's an example in which a deferred word is
initialised with an @code{xt} from an anonymous colon definition:

@example
Defer deferred
:noname ( ... -- ... )
  ... ;
IS deferred
@end example

@noindent
Gforth provides an alternative way of doing this, using two separate
words:

doc-noname
@cindex execution token of last defined word
doc-latestxt

@noindent
The previous example can be rewritten using @code{noname} and
@code{latestxt}:

@example
Defer deferred
noname : ( ... -- ... )
  ... ;
latestxt IS deferred
@end example

@noindent
@code{noname} works with any defining word, not just @code{:}.

@code{latestxt} also works when the last word was not defined as
@code{noname}.  It also has the useful property that it is valid as
soon as the header for a definition has been built.  Thus:

@example
latestxt . : foo [ latestxt . ] ; ' foo .
@end example

@noindent
prints 3 numbers; the last two are the same.


@node Quotations, Supplying names, Anonymous Definitions, Defining Words
@subsection Quotations
@cindex quotations
@cindex nested colon definitions
@cindex colon definitions, nesting

A quotation is an anonymous colon definition inside another colon
definition.  Quotations are useful when dealing with words that
consume an execution token, like @code{catch} or
@code{outfile-execute}.  E.g. consider the following example of using
@code{outfile-execute} (@pxref{Redirection}):

@example
: some-warning ( n -- )
    cr ." warning# " . ;

: print-some-warning ( n -- )
    ['] some-warning stderr outfile-execute ;
@end example

Here we defined @code{some-warning} as a helper word whose xt we could
pass to outfile-execute.  Instead, we can use a quotation to define
such a word anonymously inside @code{print-some-warning}:

@example
: print-some-warning ( n -- )
  [: cr ." warning# " . ;] stderr outfile-execute ;
@end example

The quotation is bounded by @code{[:} and @code{;]}.  It produces an
execution token at run-time.

@subsubsection User-defined defining words with colon definitions

Colon definitions are very flexible, so you can write a defining word
that defines a new colon definition at its run-time.  Here is an
example:

@source
: myconstant {: w -- :}
  : w postpone literal postpone ; ;
@end source

When defining @code{5 myconstant five}, @word{myconstant} first
stashes @i{w} in a local (for reasons explained later), then calls
@word{:}, which starts the definition of @word{five}.  Then it uses
@code{postpone literal} (@pxref{Compiling words}) to compile @i{w}
(i.e., 5) into this colon definition, and then @code{postpone ;} to
end it.  You can look at the result with @code{see five}:

@source
: five  #5 ;
@end source

Can't we just leave @i{w} on the data stack for consumption by
@code{postpone literal}?  No: @word{:} pushes a colon-sys on the data
stack, so we have to first move @i{w} elsewhere so we can later access
it.  In this example, we used a local variable, but moving @i{w} on
the return stack and back would also have been an option.

A more convenient, but Gforth-specific way to write @word{myconstant}
is:

@source
: myconstant {: w -- :}
  : ]] w ; [[ ;
@end source

The features used in this code are explained elsewhere
(@pxref{Macros}).

A disadvantage of this approach is that it consumes more memory than
the approach of the next section: E.g, here are the memory costs of
defining @code{five} with the various implementations:

@example
builtin  : does> set-does> opt     
   48   64   48     48      48  bytes header+threaded code
    0   23    0      0       0  bytes native code
   16   16   32     16      16  compiled threaded code
    4   23   34      7       4  compiled native code
@end example

@i{Builtin} refers to using @word{constant}, @i{:} to using
@code{myconstant} (defined above), @i{does>} to using
@word{myconstant2}, @i{set-does>} to using @word{myconstant3} (both
from @pxref{User-defined defining words using CREATE}), and opt to
using @word{myconstant4} (@pxref{User-defined compile-comma}).

The lines where the label starts with ``bytes'' report the space
consumption of defining the word @code{five} itself; the native code
is for gforth-fast on AMD64 (native code for the gforth engine is
larger).

The lines where the label starts with ``compiled'' report the space
consumption (also in bytes) for the invocation of @code{five} in the
word @code{: foo five * ;}.  The native code can be bigger or smaller
in other contexts.


@node User-defined defining words using CREATE, CREATE..DOES> applications, User-defined defining words with colon definitions, User-defined Defining Words
@subsubsection User-defined defining words using @word{create}
@cindex @code{CREATE} ... @code{DOES>}

If you want the words defined with your defining words to behave
differently from words defined with standard defining words, you can
write your defining word like this:

@example
: def-word ( "name" -- )
    CREATE @i{code1}
DOES> ( ... -- ... )
    @i{code2} ;

def-word name
@end example

@cindex child words
This fragment defines a @dfn{defining word} @code{def-word} and then
executes it.  When @code{def-word} executes, it @code{CREATE}s a new
word @i{name}, and executes the code @i{code1}. The code @i{code2}
is not executed at this time. The word @i{name} is sometimes called a
@dfn{child} of @code{def-word}.

When you execute @i{name}, the address of the body of @i{name} is
pushed on the data stack and @i{code2} is executed.  The address of
the body of @i{name} is the address @code{HERE} returns immediately
after the @code{CREATE}, i.e., the address a @code{create}d word
returns by default).

You can understand the behaviour of @code{def-word} and
@code{name} by considering the following definitions:
@example
: def-word1 ( "name" -- )
    CREATE @i{code1} ;

: action1 ( ... -- ... )
    @i{code2} ;

def-word1 name1
@end example

@noindent
Using @code{name1 action1} is equivalent to using @code{name}.

You can use @code{def-word} to define a set of child words that behave
similarly; they all have a common run-time behaviour determined by
@i{code2}. Typically, the @i{code1} sequence builds a data area in the
body of the child word. The structure of the data is common to all
children of @code{def-word}, but the data values are specific -- and
private -- to each child word.

As an example, here's how you can define @code{myconstant2} with
@word{does>}:

@source
: myconstant2 ( w "name" -- )
    create ,
does> ( -- w )
    @ ;
@end source

Here @word{create} defines a word @i{name}, then @word{,} stores @i{w}
in @i{name}'s data area, then the @word{does>} changes @i{name}'s
behaviour and returns to the caller of @word{myconstant2}: When
@i{name} is invoked, the new behaviour first pushes the address of the
data area (as before), but then also performs the code after the
@word{does>}.  In the present case, this code fetches the value of the
constant from the data area.

@cindex stack effect of @code{DOES>}-parts
@cindex @code{DOES>}-parts, stack effect
The stack effect besides the @word{does} reflects the stack effect of
@i{name} execution, not the stack effect of the code after the
@code{does>} (this is not common practice yet but we still recommend
it).

@cindex @code{CREATE} ... @code{SET-DOES>}
@code{Does>} splits the definition into two subdefinitions and has a
number of disadvantages.  Alternatively, Gforth allows you to provide
the second part as an execution token by using @code{set-does>}.  So
the general scheme is:

@example
: def-word ( "name" -- ; name execution: ... -- ... )
    create @i{code1}
    @i{xt-code2} set-does>
    @i{code3} ;
@end example

The difference from the definition using @word{does>} is that on
@i{name} execution, after pushing the data address, @i{xt-code2} is
@code{execute}d, rather than calling the code after the @code{does>}.
This also allows putting @i{code3} in @i{def-word}; this is
particularly relevant when you want to also use @word{set-optimizer}
(@pxref{User-defined compile-comma}) on the defined word, because
@code{does>}/@code{set-does>} calls @word{set-optimizer} itself, so
using @word{set-optimizer} before @code{does>}/@code{set-does>} has no
effect.

Here @i{xt-code2} could be the xt of an existing word, or it could be
provided through a quotation (@pxref{Quotations}).

Another advantage of @code{set-does>} is that the result is a little
more efficient if the execution token passed to it is that of a
primitive.  This advantages comes to fruition in:

@source
: myconstant3 ( w "name" -- ; name execution: -- w )
    create ,
    ['] @ set-does> ;
@end source

During @i{name} execution, after pushing the body address of @i{name},
@word{@} is executed.

The efficiency advantage shows up in the comparisons of compiled code
size (@pxref{User-defined defining words with colon definitions}); the
execution time also benefits.

@node CREATE..DOES> applications, CREATE..DOES> details, User-defined defining words using CREATE, User-defined Defining Words
@subsubsection Applications of @code{CREATE..DOES>}
@cindex @code{CREATE} ... @code{DOES>}, applications

You may wonder how to use this feature. Here are some usage patterns:

@cindex factoring similar colon definitions
When you see a sequence of code occurring several times, and you can
identify a meaning, you will factor it out as a colon definition. When
you see similar colon definitions, you can factor them using
@code{CREATE..DOES>}. E.g., an assembler usually defines several words
that look very similar:
@example
: ori, ( reg-target reg-source n -- )
    0 asm-reg-reg-imm ;
: andi, ( reg-target reg-source n -- )
    1 asm-reg-reg-imm ;
@end example

@noindent
This could be factored with:
@example
: reg-reg-imm ( op-code -- )
    CREATE ,
DOES> ( reg-target reg-source n -- )
    @@ asm-reg-reg-imm ;

0 reg-reg-imm ori,
1 reg-reg-imm andi,
@end example

@cindex currying
Another view of @code{CREATE..DOES>} is to consider it as a crude way to
supply a part of the parameters for a word (known as @dfn{currying} in
the functional language community). E.g., @code{+} needs two
parameters. Creating versions of @code{+} with one parameter fixed can
be done like this:

@example
: curry+ ( n1 "name" -- )
    CREATE ,
DOES> ( n2 -- n1+n2 )
    @@ + ;

 3 curry+ 3+
-2 curry+ 2-
@end example


@node CREATE..DOES> details, Advanced does> usage example, CREATE..DOES> applications, User-defined Defining Words
@subsubsection The gory details of @code{CREATE..DOES>}
@cindex @code{CREATE} ... @code{DOES>}, details

doc-does>

@cindex @code{DOES>} in a separate definition
You can put the @code{does>}-part in a different definition than the
@code{create} part. This allows us to, e.g., select among different
@code{DOES>}-parts:
@example
: does1 
DOES> ( ... -- ... )
    code1 ;

: does2
DOES> ( ... -- ... )
    code2 ;

: def-word ( ... -- ... )
    create ...
    IF
       does1
    ELSE
       does2
    THEN ;
@end example

In this example, the selection of whether to use @code{does1} or
@code{does2} is made at definition-time, i.e., at the time when the
child word is @code{CREATE}d.

Note that the property of @code{does>} to end the definition makes it
necessary to introduce extra definitions @code{does1} and
@code{does2}.  You can avoid that with @code{set-does>}:

@example
: def-word ( ... -- ... )
    create ...
    IF
       [: code1 ;] set-does>
    ELSE
       [: code2 ;] set-does>
    THEN ;
@end example

doc-set-does>

@cindex @code{DOES>} in interpretation state
In a standard program you can apply a @code{DOES>}-part only if the last
word was defined with @code{CREATE}. In Gforth, the @code{DOES>}-part
will override the behaviour of the last word defined in any case. In a
standard program, you can use @code{DOES>} only in a colon
definition. In Gforth, you can also use it in interpretation state, in a
kind of one-shot mode; for example:
@example
CREATE name ( ... -- ... )
  @i{initialization}
DOES>
  @i{code} ;
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to the standard:
@example
:noname
DOES>
    @i{code} ;
CREATE name EXECUTE ( ... -- ... )
    @i{initialization}
@end example

Gforth also supports quotations in interpreted code, and quotations
save and restore the current definition, so you can also write the
example above also as:

@example
CREATE name ( ... -- ... )
  @i{initialization}
[: @i{code} ;] set-does>
@end example

doc->body

You can access the data area of a @word{create}d word with
@word{>body}, including words where the behaviour has been changed
with @code{does>}/@code{set-does>}.  So if you know that @code{five}
has been defined with, e.g., @word{myconstant3} (@pxref{User-defined
defining words using CREATE}), you can change its value with

@source
7 ' five >body !
@end source

and performing @code{five} will then push 7.  By contrast, for words
defined with @word{myconstant} (defined using @word{:},
@pxref{User-defined defining words with colon definitions}) you cannot
change the value in this way.

However, if a word uses @word{set-optimizer} (@pxref{User-defined
compile-comma}) for a more efficient implementation of the compiled
code for a word, in many cases the compiled code does not read data
from the body of this word, and in that case changing the data by
using @code{>body} will not have the desired effect.  So looking at
the source code of a defining word and seeing @word{create} is not
enough to conclude that you can change the data and it will affect all
existing uses.  An example of that is @word{myconstant4}
(@pxref{User-defined compile-comma}).

So it's a good idea to document whether the intention behind a
defining word using @word{create} is that it's data should be
changeable through @word{>body}.


@node Advanced does> usage example, Words with user-defined TO etc., CREATE..DOES> details, User-defined Defining Words
@subsubsection Advanced does> usage example

The MIPS disassembler (@file{arch/mips/disasm.fs}) contains many words
for disassembling instructions, that follow a very repetitive scheme:

@example
:noname @var{disasm-operands} s" @var{inst-name}" type ;
@var{entry-num} cells @var{table} + !
@end example

Of course, this inspires the idea to factor out the commonalities to
allow a definition like

@example
@var{disasm-operands} @var{entry-num} @var{table} define-inst @var{inst-name}
@end example

The parameters @var{disasm-operands} and @var{table} are usually
correlated.  Moreover, before I wrote the disassembler, there already
existed code that defines instructions like this:

@example
@var{entry-num} @var{inst-format} @var{inst-name}
@end example

This code comes from the assembler and resides in
@file{arch/mips/insts.fs}.

So I had to define the @var{inst-format} words that performed the scheme
above when executed.  At first I chose to use run-time code-generation:

@example
: @var{inst-format} ( entry-num "name" -- ; compiled code: addr w -- )
  :noname Postpone @var{disasm-operands}
  name Postpone sliteral Postpone type Postpone ;
  swap cells @var{table} + ! ;
@end example

Note that this supplies the other two parameters of the scheme above.

An alternative would have been to write this using
@code{create}/@code{does>}:

@example
: @var{inst-format} ( entry-num "name" -- )
  here name string, ( entry-num c-addr ) \ parse and save "name"
  noname create , ( entry-num )
  latestxt swap cells @var{table} + !
does> ( addr w -- )
  \ disassemble instruction w at addr
  @@ >r 
  @var{disasm-operands}
  r> count type ;
@end example

Somehow the first solution is simpler, mainly because it's simpler to
shift a string from definition-time to use-time with @code{sliteral}
than with @code{string,} and friends.

I wrote a lot of words following this scheme and soon thought about
factoring out the commonalities among them.  Note that this uses a
two-level defining word, i.e., a word that defines ordinary defining
words.

This time a solution involving @code{postpone} and friends seemed more
difficult (try it as an exercise), so I decided to use a
@code{create}/@code{does>} word; since I was already at it, I also used
@code{create}/@code{does>} for the lower level (try using
@code{postpone} etc. as an exercise), resulting in the following
definition:

@example
: define-format ( disasm-xt table-xt -- )
    \ define an instruction format that uses disasm-xt for
    \ disassembling and enters the defined instructions into table
    \ table-xt
    create 2,
does> ( u "inst" -- )
    \ defines an anonymous word for disassembling instruction inst,
    \ and enters it as u-th entry into table-xt
    2@@ swap here name string, ( u table-xt disasm-xt c-addr ) \ remember string
    noname create 2,      \ define anonymous word
    execute latestxt swap ! \ enter xt of defined word into table-xt
does> ( addr w -- )
    \ disassemble instruction w at addr
    2@@ >r ( addr w disasm-xt R: c-addr )
    execute ( R: c-addr ) \ disassemble operands
    r> count type ; \ print name 
@end example

Note that the tables here (in contrast to above) do the @code{cells +}
by themselves (that's why you have to pass an xt).  This word is used in
the following way:

@example
' @var{disasm-operands} ' @var{table} define-format @var{inst-format}
@end example

As shown above, the defined instruction format is then used like this:

@example
@var{entry-num} @var{inst-format} @var{inst-name}
@end example

In terms of currying, this kind of two-level defining word provides the
parameters in three stages: first @var{disasm-operands} and @var{table},
then @var{entry-num} and @var{inst-name}, finally @code{addr w}, i.e.,
the instruction to be disassembled.  

Of course this did not quite fit all the instruction format names used
in @file{insts.fs}, so I had to define a few wrappers that conditioned
the parameters into the right form.

If you have trouble following this section, don't worry.  First, this is
involved and takes time (and probably some playing around) to
understand; second, this is the first two-level
@code{create}/@code{does>} word I have written in seventeen years of
Forth; and if I did not have @file{insts.fs} to start with, I may well
have elected to use just a one-level defining word (with some repeating
of parameters when using the defining word). So it is not necessary to
understand this, but it may improve your understanding of Forth.

When you define a word @emph{x}, you can set its execution semantics

also change the semantics of

@example

action-of @emph{x} \ aka `@emph{x} defer@@

@cindex @code{addr @emph{name}} semantics, changing them
@cindex semantics, changing the @code{to}/@code{+to}/@code{action-of}/@code{is}/@code{addr @emph{name}} semantics

This is all achieved through a common mechanism described in this
section.  As an example, let's define @code{dvalue} (it behaves in
Gforth exactly like @code{2value}, @pxref{Values}).  The code is as
follows, explained below:

@source
: d+! ( d addr -- )
  dup >r 2@ d+ r> 2! ;

\                  to +to action-of is  addr
to-table: d!-table 2! d+!    n/a    n/a [noop] 

' >body d!-table to-class: dvalue-to

: dvalue ( d "name" -- )
  create 2,
  ['] 2@ set-does>
  ['] dvalue-to set-to ;

#5. dvalue x
#2. +to x
x d. \ prints 7
@end source

First, we define the support word @word{d+!}.

Next, we define @word{d!-table}, a table of the various @code{to}-like
actions.

For actions that are not supported, we put @word{n/a} in the table,
and when you try to use, e.g., @code{is x}, exception -21 (unsupported
operation) is thrown.

For the @code{to} and @code{+to} actions, we have to provide words
with the stack effect @code{( d addr -- )}, where @i{addr} is the
address where the data of the value-flavoured word is stored.  For
@word{addr} (only supported for @word{addressable:} words), we have to
provide a word with the stack effect @code{( addr1 -- addr2 )}; in the
usual case, both addresses are the same, and we can just provide
@word{[noop]}.  For the general case, see the description of
@word{to-table:} below.

Next, the defining word @word{to-class:} combines the @code{d!-table}
with the address-computation word @code{>body}, resulting in the
definition of @code{dvalue-to}.@footnote{The same to-table is often
combined with different address computation words (e.g., for global
values, user values, value-flavoured fields and locals), that's why
the definition of the to-table is separated from the definition of the
to-class.}  The address-computation word has the stack effect @code{(
... xt -- addr )}.  When invoking @code{+to x}, the xt of @code{x} is
pushed and then the address-computation word (@code{>body}) is called;
the result is the address that is then passed on to @code{d+!} (from
@code{d!-table}).

For @code{dvalue} that's all, but in other cases, e.g.,
value-flavoured fields (@pxref{Value-Flavoured and Defer-Flavoured
Fields}), additional stack items can be consumed by the
address-computation word, and those have to be provided by the user as
stack-top values when invoking, e.g., @code{to @i{field}}.

Next, we have the definition of @code{dvalue}, which is a
straightforward @code{create}...@code{set-does>} word that also tells
@i{name} with @word{set-to} how it should behave for @word{to} etc.

Finally, we use @word{dvalue} to define @word{x} and use it.  The line
using @code{+to} exercises the @code{set-to} mechanism:

@source
#2. +to x
@end source

performs

@source
#2. ' x >body d+!
@end source

The @word{>body} is the address-computation word given in the
definition of @word{dvalue-to}, and the @word{d+!} is the @word{+to}
entry in @word{d!-table}.

These are the words mentioned above:

doc-to-table:

The stack effects of the actions are:

@itemize

@item
For the @word{to} and @word{+to} action: @code{( value addr -- )}, where
@i{value} has the appropriate type (e.g., a double-cell in our
@word{dvalue} example).

@item
For the @word{action-of} action: @code{( addr -- xt )}

@item
For the @word{is} action: @code{( xt addr -- )}

@item
For the @word{addr} action: @code{( addr1 -- addr2 )}

@end itemize

The @i{addr} input parameter in all these cases is the address of the
memory where the value of the xt is stored.

The default mechanism means that @word{d!-table} could instead have
been defined as follows:

@source
\                  to +to action-of is  addr
to-table: d!-table 2! d+!
@end source

doc-n/a
doc-to-class:
doc->uvalue
doc-set-to


@node User-defined compile-comma, Creating from a prototype, Words with user-defined TO etc., User-defined Defining Words
@subsubsection User-defined @code{compile,}

You can also change the implementation of @code{compile,} for a word,
with

doc-set-optimizer
doc-opt:

Note that the resulting @code{compile,} must still be equivalent to
@code{postpone literal postpone execute}, so @code{set-optimizer} is
useful for efficiency, not for changing the behaviour.  There is
nothing that prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot, however.
You can check whether your uses of @code{set-optimizer} are correct by
comparing the results when you use it with the results you get when
you disable your uses by first defining

@example
: set-optimizer drop ;
@end example

As an example of the use of @code{set-optimizer}, we can enhance
@word{myconstant3} as follows.

@source
: myconstant4 ( n "name" -- ; name: -- n )
  create ,
  ['] @ set-does>
  [: >body @ postpone literal ;] set-optimizer
;
@end source

The only change is the addition of the @code{set-optimizer} line.
When you define a constant and compile it:

@example
5 myconstant4 five
: foo five ;
@end example

the compiled @code{five} in @code{foo} is now compiled to the literal
5 instead of a generic invocation of @code{five}.  The quotation has
the same stack effect as @code{compile,}: @code{( xt -- )}.  The
passed xt belongs to the @code{compile,}d word, i.e., @code{five} in
the example.  In the example the xt is first converted to the body
address, then the value 5 at that place is fetched, and that value is
compiled with the @code{postpone literal} (@pxref{Literals}).

This use of @code{set-optimizer} assumes that the user does not change
the value of a constant with, e.g., @code{6 ' five >body !}.  While
@code{five} has been defined with @code{create}, that is an
implementation detail of @code{CONSTANT}, and if you don't document
it, the user must not rely on it.  And if you use @code{set-optimizer}
in a way that assumes that the body does not change (like is done
here), you must not document that @code{create} is used; and
conversely, if you document it, you have to write the @code{compile,}
implementation such that it can deal with changing bodies.

Note that the call to @code{set-optimizer} has to be performed after
the call to @code{set-does>} (or @code{does>}, because
@code{set-does>} overwrites the @code{compile,} implementation itself.

We can also apply @code{set-optimizer} to individual words rather than
inside a defining word like @code{constant}.  In this case, the xt of
the word passed to optimizer is usually unnecessary and is
@code{drop}ped.  As an simple example, let's define a word that is
inlined when being compiled:

@source
: compile-my2dup ( xt -- )
  drop ]] over over [[ ;

: my2dup over over ;
' compile-my2dup set-optimizer

: foo my2dup ;
see my2dup
@end source

An alternative way to define @word{my2dup} is:

@source
: my2dup over over ;
opt: drop ]] over over [[ ;
@end source

@word{Opt:} starts an anonymous definition that is then (internally)
attached to @word{my2dup} with @word{set-optimize}.

One disadvantage of these approaches is that @code{over over} occurs
twice.  This can be avoided by using @word{compile-my2dup} to define
@word{my2dup}:

@example
: compile-my2dup ( xt -- )
    drop ]] over over [[ ;

: my2dup [ 0 compile-my2dup ] ;
' compile-my2dup set-optimizer
@end example

Finally, a convenient way to write words like @word{my2dup} is to use
@word{inline:} (@pxref{Inline Definitions}), but it is limited to
inlining.

The engine @code{gforth-itc} uses @code{,} for @code{compile,} in
nearly all cases and @code{set-optimizer} usually has no effect there.


@node Creating from a prototype, Making a word current, User-defined compile-comma, User-defined Defining Words
@subsubsection Creating from a prototype

In the above we show how to define a word by first using
@code{create}, and then modifying it with @code{immediate},
@code{set-does>}, @code{set-to}, @code{set-optimizer} etc.

An alternative way is to create a prototype using these words, and
then create a new word from that prototype.  This kind of copying does
not cover the body, so that has to be allocated and initialized
explicitly.  Taking @code{dvalue} above, we could instead define it
as:

@source
create dvalue-prototype ( -- d )
`2@ set-does>
`dvalue-to set-to

: dvalue ( d "name" -- ; name: -- d )
  ``dvalue-prototype create-from 2, reveal ;
@end source

An advantage of this approach is that creating words with
@code{dvalue} is now faster.@footnote{The non-prototype method first
duplicates the header methods of @code{create}, modify them, and
eventually deduplicate them.  The @word{create-from} approach
eliminates this overhead.}  But this advantage is only relevant if the
number of words created with this defining word is huge.

doc-create-from
doc-reveal
doc-reveal!

The performance advantage does not extend to using @code{noname} with
the defining word.  Therefore we also have

doc-noname-from

Here's a usage example:

@example
``dvalue-prototype noname create-from
latestnt constant noname-dvalue-prototype

: noname-dvalue ( d -- xt ; xt execution: -- d )
  noname-dvalue-prototype noname-from 2,
  latestxt ;

A frequent use of @code{create}...@code{does>} is for transferring
some values from definition-time to run-time.  Other ways of achieving
this are closures (@pxref{Closures}), and with colon definitions
(@pxref{User-defined defining words with colon definitions}), but
another way of achieving this is to use

doc-const-does>

A typical use of this word is:

@example
: curry+ ( n1 "name" -- )
1 0 CONST-DOES> ( n2 -- n1+n2 )
    + ;

3 curry+ 3+
@end example

Here the @code{1 0} means that 1 cell and 0 floats are transferred from
definition to run-time.

The advantages of using @code{const-does>} compared to
@code{create}...@code{does>} are:

@itemize

@item
You don't have to deal with storing and retrieving the values, i.e.,
your program becomes more writable and readable.

@item
When using @code{does>}, you have to introduce a @word{@} that cannot
be optimized away automatically (because the system does not know
whether you allow to access the data with @code{>body}...@code{!}).
You can address this problem with @word{set-optimizer}
(@pxref{User-defined compile-comma}), but @code{const-does>} avoids
it; however, the current implementation is still not particularly
efficient.

@node Deferred Words, Synonyms, User-defined Defining Words, Defining Words

The defining word @code{Defer} allows you to define a word by name
without defining its behaviour; the definition of its behaviour is
deferred. Here are two situation where this can be useful:

In the following example, @code{foo} always invokes the version of
@code{greet} that prints ``@code{Good morning}'' whilst @code{bar}
always invokes the version that prints ``@code{Hello}''. There is no way
of getting @code{foo} to use the later version without re-ordering the
source code and recompiling it.

@example
: greet ." Good morning" ;
: foo ... greet ... ;
: greet ." Hello" ;
: bar ... greet ... ;
@end example

This problem can be solved by defining @code{greet} as a @code{Defer}red
word. The behaviour of a @code{Defer}red word can be defined and
redefined at any time by using @code{IS} to associate the xt of a
previously-defined word with it. The previous example becomes:

@example
Defer greet ( -- )
: foo ... greet ... ;
: bar ... greet ... ;
: greet1 ( -- ) ." Good morning" ;
: greet2 ( -- ) ." Hello" ;
' greet2 IS greet  \ make greet behave like greet2
@end example

@progstyle
You should write a stack comment for every deferred word, and put only
XTs into deferred words that conform to this stack effect.  Otherwise
it's too difficult to use the deferred word.

One thing to note is that @code{IS} has special compilation semantics,
such that it parses the name at compile time (like @code{TO}):

@example
: set-greet ( xt -- )
  IS greet ;

' greet1 set-greet
@end example

doc-defer
doc-is

You can extract the xt of a @word{defer}red word with @code{action-of}:

@source
action-of greet ( xt ) >name id.
@end source

doc-action-of

One usage for deferred words is the definition of a an action (e.g.,
initialization) in several pieces, each piece in a different source
file dealing with the matters of that source file.  This can be done
with

@source
defer myspeech ( -- )
:noname cr ." <central message>" ; is myspeech

\ and in every source file where you want to add a piece, something like
:noname ( -- )
  cr ." <introduction>"
  [ action-of myspeech compile, ]
  cr ." <conclusion>"
; is myspeech
@end source

The @code{[ action-of myspeech compile, ]} calls the previous content
of @word{myspeech}.  Gforth offers the words @word{:is} and
@word{defers} to express the last definition more conveniently:

@source
:is myspeech ( -- )
  cr ." <introduction>"
  defers myspeech
  cr ." <conclusion>" ;
@end source

doc-:is
doc-defers

Another usage is to change a deferred word temporarily, and later
change it back.  Gforth provides words for supporting this usage.  The
use of @word{preserve} is shown in this example:

@source
: smalltalk ( -- )
  greet ."  Isn't the weather nice?" ;

\ here GREET performs GREET2
: when-in-rome ( xt -- )
  [: ." Buon Giorno!" ;] is greet
  execute
  preserve greet \ Equivalent to: ['] greet2 is greet
;

' greet1 is greet
greet \ "Good Morning" 
' smalltalk when-in-rome \ "Buon Giorno! Isn't the weather nice?"
greet \ "Hello"
@end source

doc-preserve

@word{Preserve} is only appropriate when you want to restore the
deferred word to a fixed xt.  If you want to change a deferred
temporarily and then restore its old run-time value, use
@word{wrap-xt}:

@source
: when-in-rome2 ( xt -- )
  [: ." Buon Giorno!" ;] ['] greet rot wrap-xt ;

' greet1 is greet
greet \ "Good Morning" 
' smalltalk when-in-rome2 \ "Buon Giorno! Isn't the weather nice?"
greet \ "Good Morning"
@end source

doc-wrap-xt

For implementing words like @word{wrap-xt} to which you pass the xt of
a deferred word, you cannot use @word{is} and @word{action-of}, which
consume a name from the input stream.  Instead, you use the words
@word{defer!} and @word{defer@}.

doc-defer!
doc-defer@

A deferred word can only inherit execution semantics from the xt
(because that is all that an xt can represent -- for more discussion of
this @pxref{Tokens for Words}); by default it will have default
interpretation and compilation semantics deriving from this execution
semantics.  However, you can change the interpretation and compilation
semantics of the deferred word in the usual ways:

@example
: bar .... ; immediate
Defer fred immediate
Defer jim

' bar IS jim  \ jim has default semantics
' bar IS fred \ fred is immediate
@end example

@c Use @code{words-deferred} to see a list of deferred words.


@node Synonyms,  , Deferred Words, Defining Words
@subsection Synonyms
@cindex aliases
@cindex synonyms

The defining word @code{synonym} allows you to define
a word by name that has the same behaviour as some other word. Here
are two situation where this can be useful:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When you want access to a word's definition from a different word list
(for an example of this, see the definitions in the @code{Root} word list
in the Gforth source).
@item
When you want to create a synonym; a definition that can be known by
either of two names (for example, @code{THEN} and @code{ENDIF} can be
defined as synonyms).
@end itemize

doc-synonym

Gforth also offers the Gforth-specific @code{alias}, that allows to
define another word with the same execution token, but otherwise
default semantics (no copying of compilation or other semantics).  You
can then change, e.g., the compilation semantics with, e.g.,
@code{immediate}.

doc-alias

Example:

@source
: foo ." foo" ; immediate

' foo Alias bar1           \ bar1 is not an immediate word
' foo Alias bar2 immediate \ bar2 is an immediate word
synonym bar3 foo           \ bar3 is an immediate word
: test-bar1 bar1 ; \ no output
test-bar1          \ "foo"
: test-bar2 bar2 ; \ "foo"
test-bar2          \ no output
: test-bar3 bar3 ; \ "foo"
test-bar3          \ no output
@end source

Both synonyms and aliases have a different nt than the original, but
ticking it (or using @code{name>interpret}) produces the same xt as
the original (@pxref{Tokens for Words}).

@section  Structures
@cindex structures
@cindex records

A structure (aka record) is a collection of fields that are stored
together.  The fields can have different types and are accessed by
name.  There are typically several instances of a structure, otherwise
programmers tend to prefer using a variable or somesuch for each
field.

In Forth you can use raw address arithmetic to access fields of
structures, but using field names and defining field access words with
the defining words described in this section makes the code more readable.

@node Standard Structures, Value-Flavoured and Defer-Flavoured Fields, Structures, Structures
@subsection Standard Structures
@cindex Structures in Forth200x

The Forth 2012 standard defines a number of words for defining fields
and structures.

A typical example of defining a structure with several fields is:

@example
0 \ offset of first field, 0 in the usual case
  field: intlist-next ( intlist -- addr1 )
  field: intlist-val  ( intlist -- addr2 )
constant intlist ( -- u )
@end example

An equivalent alternative way of defining this structure is:

@example
begin-structure intlist ( -- u )
  field: intlist-next ( intlist -- addr1 )
  field: intlist-val  ( intlist -- addr2 )
end-structure
@end example

@code{Intlist} returns the size of the structure.  The convention for
the field names here is to prepend the structure name, so that you
don't run into conflicts when several structures have @code{next} and
@code{val} fields; in Forth, by default field names are in the same
wordlist (i.e., the same name space) as the other words (including
other field names), and trying to use the search order (@pxref{Word
Lists}) for avoiding conflicts is rather cumbersome (unless you use
the scope recognizer @pxref{Default recognizers}).

You can then use that to allocate an instance of that structure and
then use the field words to access the fields of that instance:

@example
intlist allocate throw constant my-intlist1
0 my-intlist1 intlist-next !
5 my-intlist1 intlist-val  !

intlist allocate throw constant my-intlist2
my-intlist1 my-intlist2 intlist-next !
7           my-intlist2 intlist-val !

: intlist-sum ( intlist -- n )
\ "intlist" is a pointer to the first element of a linked list
\ "n" is the sum of the intlist-val fields in the linked list
    0 BEGIN ( intlist1 n1 )
        over
    WHILE ( list1 n1 )
        over intlist-val @@ +
        swap intlist-next @@ swap
    REPEAT
    nip ;

my-intlist2 intlist-sum . \ prints "12"
@end example

The words for defining structures and fields of various types are:

doc-begin-structure
doc-end-structure
doc-cfield:
doc-field:
doc-2field:
doc-ffield:
doc-sffield:
doc-dffield:
doc-wfield:
doc-lfield:
doc-xfield:

If you need something beyond these field types, you can use
@code{+field} to define fields of arbitrary size.  You have to ensure
the correct alignment yourself in this case.  E.g., if you want to put
one struct inside another struct, you would do it with

@example
0
  cfield:                nested-foo
  aligned intlist +field nested-bar
constant nested
@end example

In this example the field @code{nested-bar} contains an intlist
structure, so the size of @code{intlist} is passed to @code{+field}.
An @code{intlist} must be cell-aligned (it contains cell fields), and
this is achieved by aligning the current field offset with
@code{aligned} before the field definition.  Our recommendation is to
always precede the usage of @code{+field} with an appropriate
alignment word (except if character-alignment is good enough for the
field); this ensures that the field will stay correctly aligned even
if other fields are later inserted before the @code{+field}-defined
field.

doc-+field

@cindex first field optimization
The first field is at the base address of a structure and the word for
this field (e.g., @code{list-next}) actually does not change the
address on the stack. You may be tempted to leave it away in the
interest of run-time and space efficiency. This is not necessary,
because Gforth and other Forth systems optimize this case: If you
compile a first-field word, no code is generated. So, in the interest
of readability and maintainability you should include the word for the
field when accessing the field.


@node Value-Flavoured and Defer-Flavoured Fields, Structure Extension, Standard Structures, Structures
@subsection Value-Flavoured and Defer-Flavoured Fields

In addition to the variable-flavoured fields that produce an address
(@pxref{Standard Structures}), Gforth also provides value-flavoured
fields.  Like all fields, value-flavoured fields consume the start
address of the struct, but they produce their value and you can apply
@code{to}, @code{+to} and (if the field is @code{addressable:},
@pxref{Values}) @code{addr} on them.  E.g., we can do something like
the @code{intlist} definition (@pxref{Standard Structures}):

@example
0
               value: intlist>next ( intlista -- intlista1 )
  addressable: value: intlist>val  ( intlista -- n )
constant intlista ( -- u )
@end example

This means that there are the following ways of accessing
@code{intlist>val}:

@example
intlist>val ( intlista -- n )
->intlist>val ( n intlista -- ) \ aka  to intlist>val
+>intlist>val ( n intlista -- ) \ aka +to intlist>val
addr intlist>val ( intlista -- addr )
@end example

And here's the earlier example (@pxref{Standard Structures}) rewritten
to use @code{intlista}:

@example
intlista allocate throw constant my-intlista1
0 my-intlista1 to intlist>next
5 my-intlista1 to intlist>val

intlista allocate throw constant my-intlista2
my-intlista1 my-intlista2 to intlist>next
7            my-intlista2 to intlist>val

: intlista-sum ( intlista -- n )
\ "intlista" is a pointer to the first element of a linked list
\ "n" is the sum of the intlist>val fields in the linked list
    0 BEGIN ( intlista1 n1 )
        over
    WHILE ( list1 n1 )
        over intlist>val +
        swap intlist>next swap
    REPEAT
    nip ;

my-intlista2 intlista-sum . \ prints "12"
@end example

Depending on the type of the field, the value can be something
different than a single cell.

doc-value:
doc-cvalue:
doc-wvalue:
doc-lvalue:
doc-scvalue:
doc-swvalue:
doc-slvalue:
doc-2value:
doc-fvalue:
doc-sfvalue:
doc-dfvalue:
doc-zvalue:
doc-$value:

Gforth also has field words for dealing with dynamically-sized arrays.
A field for such an array contains just a cell that points to the
actual data, and this cell has to be set to 0 before accessing the
array the first time.  When accessing the field (without operator, or
with @code{to} or @code{+to}), there has to be the index and the
structure address on the stack, with the structure address on top.
Any further items consumed by @code{to} or @code{+to} are below the
index on the stack.  The array expands to the size given by the
maximum access; any unset elements are 0; for @code{$value[]}
accessing them produces a 0-length (i.e., empty) string.

Here is a usage example:

@example
0
  value[]:  bla>x[]
  $value[]: bla>$y[]
constant bla

bla allocate throw constant mybla
mybla bla erase \ set all fields to 0

5 2 mybla to bla>x[] \ access at index 2
7 0 mybla to bla>x[] \ access at index 0
2 mybla bla>x[] . \ prints "5"
3 mybla bla>x[] . \ prints "0"
"foo" 2 mybla to bla>$y[]  \ access at index 2
"bla" 1 mybla to bla>$y[]  \ access at index 1
"bar" 2 mybla +to bla>$y[] \ access at index 2
0 mybla bla>$y[] . . \ prints "0 0"
1 mybla bla>$y[] type \ prints "bla"
2 mybla bla>$y[] type \ prints "foobar"
@end example

doc-value[]:
doc-$value[]:

Finally, you can define defer-flavoured fields.  Here is a usage
example:

@source
0
  addressable: defer: foo'bar
constant foo

foo allocate throw constant my-foo
:noname ." test" ; my-foo is foo'bar
my-foo foo'bar                   \ prints "test"
my-foo addr foo'bar @ execute   \ prints "test"
my-foo action-of foo'bar execute \ prints "test"
my-foo `foo'bar defer@ execute   \ prints "test"
:noname ." test1" ; my-foo `foo'bar defer!
my-foo foo'bar                   \ prints "test1"
@end source

doc-defer:

For documentation of @code{is}, @code{action-of}, @code{defer@@},
@code{defer!}, see @xref{Deferred Words}.  Note however, that when
used on defer-flavoured fields, all these words consume the start
address of the structure, unlike for words defined with @code{defer}.

@node Structure Extension, Gforth structs, Value-Flavoured and Defer-Flavoured Fields, Structures
@subsection Structure Extension
@cindex structure extension
@cindex extended records

You can create a new structure starting with an existing structure and
its fields.  E.g., if we also want to define @code{floatlist}, we can
factor out the @code{...-next} field into a general structure
@code{list} without payload, and then define @code{intlist} and
@code{floatlist} as extensions of @code{list}:@footnote{This feature
is also known as @emph{extended records} in Oberon.}

@example
0
  field: list-next ( list -- addr )
constant list ( -- u )

list
  field: intlist-val ( intlist -- addr )
constant intlist ( -- u )

list
  ffield: floatlist-val ( floatlist -- addr )
constant floatlist ( -- u )
@end example

Note that in this variant there is no @code{intlist-next} nor a
@code{floatlist-next}, just a @code{list-next}; so when you use, e.g.,
a @code{floatlist}, the organization through extension of @code{list}
is exposed.  This may make it harder to refactor things, so you may
prefer to also introduce synonyms @code{intlist-next} and
@code{floatlist-next}.

If you prefer to use @code{begin-structure}...@code{end-structure},
you can do the equivalent definition as follows:

@example
begin-structure list ( -- u )
  field: list-next ( list -- addr )
end-structure

list extend-structure intlist
  field: intlist-val  ( intlist -- addr )
end-structure

list extend-structure floatlist
  ffield: floatlist-val  ( floatlist -- addr )
end-structure
@end example

doc-extend-structure



@node Gforth structs,  , Structure Extension, Structures
@subsection Gforth structs

Gforth has had structs before the standard had them; they are a little
different, and you can still use them.  One benefit of the Gforth
structs is that they propagate knowledge of alignment requirements, so
if you build the @code{nested} structure (@pxref{Standard
Structures}), you do not need to look inside @code{intlist} to find
out the proper alignment, and you also do not need to mention
alignment at all.  Instead, this example would look like:

@example
struct
  cell% field intlist-next
  cell% field intlist-val
end-struct intlist%

struct
  char%    field nested-foo
  intlist% field nested-bar
end-struct nested%
@end example

The fields are variable-flavoured, i.e., they work in the same way as
those defined with @code{field:}, @code{+field} etc.

A disadvantage of the Gforth structs is that, with the standard going
for something else, you need to learn additional material to write and
understand code that uses them.  Another disadvantage of the Gforth
structs is that they do not support value-flavoured or defer-flavoured
fields.  On the balance, in our opinion the disadvantages now outweigh
the advantages, so we recommend using the standard structure words
(@pxref{Standard Structures}).  Nevertheless, here is the
documentation for Gforth's structs.
@cindex @code{field} usage
@cindex @code{struct} usage
@cindex @code{end-struct} usage

The @code{list} and @code{intlist} examples look like this with Gforth
structs:

@example
struct
  cell% field list-next
end-struct list%

list%
  cell% field intlist-val
end-struct intlist%
@end example

@code{Intlist%} contains information about size and alignment, and you
use @code{%size} to get the size, e.g., for allocation:

@example
intlist% %size allocate throw constant my-intlist1
@end example

A shorthand for that is

@example
intlist% %alloc constant my-intlist1
@end example

The fields behave the same way, so the rest of the example works as
with standard structures.

In addition to specifying single cells with @code{cell%}, you can also
specify an array of, e.g., 10 cells like this:

@example
  cell% 10 * field bla-blub
  \ equivalent to the standard:
  \ aligned 10 cells +field bla-blub
@end example

You can use @code{cell% 10 *} not just with @code{field}, but also in
other places where an alignment and size is expected, e.g., with
@code{%alloc}.

Gforth supports user-defined stacks.  They are used for implementing
features such as recognizer sequences, but you can also define stacks
for your own purposes.  And these stacks actually support inserting
and deleting at both ends, so they are actually double-ended queues
(deques).  In addition, they support inserting and deleting in the
middle.

In Gforth the stacks grow as necessary, but the interface is designed
to also support resource-constrained systems that allocate fixed-size
stacks, where exceeding the stack size results in an error.  So you
should provide the size parameter accordingly.

A stack is represented on the data stack by a cell.

@section Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@cindex semantics, interpretation and compilation

In Gforth every named word has interpretation and compilation
semantics, i.e., separate actions that are performed in various
contexts.

In principle these semantics can be anything and completely
independent of each other, but in practice they are usually connected,
and words usually have default compilation semantics (compile the
interpretation semantics) or immediate compilation semantics (perform
the interpretation semantics); a few have other combinations of
interpretation and compilation semantics (combined words).

@cindex interpretation semantics (aka execution semantics)
@cindex execution semantics (aka interpretation semantics)
@cindex semantics, interpretation/execution
The standard also discusses execution semantics, but it uses them only
to define interpretation and/or compilation semantics, so they are not
as essential as interpretation and compilation semantics.  In
particular, for every word in the standard that has both
interpretation and execution semantics, they are the same.  In Gforth
(since 1.0), they are always the same, and this manual uses the terms
interchangeably, usually preferring interpretation semantics.  In the
description of defining words, you see ``@i{name} execution'', which
describes the interpretation/execution semantics of @i{name}.

Some named words also have some of
@code{to}/@code{+to}/@code{action-of}/@code{is}/@code{addr @i{name}}
semantics, but these are mostly discussed elsewhere (@pxref{Values},
@pxref{Deferred Words}, @pxref{Words with user-defined TO etc.})

@node Where are interpretation semantics used?, Where are compilation semantics used?, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@subsection Where are interpretation semantics used?
@cindex interpretation semantics, usage

The most common use of the interpretation semantics of a word @i{w} is
when @i{w} is text-interpreted in interpretation state, the default
state of the text interpreter.

I.e., when you start Gforth and type

@source
s" hello" type
@end source

the text interpreter performs the interpretation semantics of the
words @word{s"} and @word{type}.

Also, when you get the execution token of a word @i{w} with
@code{`@i{w}}, @code{' @i{w}} or @code{['] @i{w}} (@pxref{Execution
token}), the execution token represents the interpretation semantics.

When you get the execution token of the most recently defined word
with @word{latestxt} (@pxref{Anonymous Definitions}), that also refers
to the interpretation semantics of the word.

Finally, @word{name>interpret} (@pxref{Name token}) produces an
execution token that represents the interpretation semantics of the
word.

@node  Where are compilation semantics used?, Which semantics do existing words have?, Where are interpretation semantics used?, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@subsection Where are compilation semantics used?
@cindex compilation semantics, usage

The most common use of the compilation semantics of a word @i{w} is
when @i{w} is text-interpreted in compile state, the state right after
starting a definition with, e.g., @word{:}.

@source
: hello
  s" hello" type ;
@end source

In this example, the text interpreter performs the compilation
semantics of @word{s"}, @word{type} and @word{;} (after first
performing the interpretation semantics of @word{:})

When you postpone a word, you also use the compilation semantics.

@source
: compile-+ ( -- ) \ compiled code: ( n1 n2 -- n )
  POSTPONE + ;

: foo ( n1 n2 -- n )
  [ compile-+ ] ;

see foo
@end source

Here the @code{POSTPONE +} compiles the compilation semantics of
@word{+} into @word{compile-+} (By contrast, just writing @word{+} in
this place would result in @emph{performing} the compilation semantics
of @word{+}, and because this is a word with default compilation
semantics, that would compile the @emph{execution/interpretation}
semantics of @word{+}).  In the definition of @word{foo}, (the
interpretation semantics of) @code{compile-+} is performed, which in
turn performs the compilation semantics of @word{+}, i.e., it compiles
@word{+} into @word{foo}.

The compilation semantics is represented by a compilation token
(@pxref{Compilation token}).  You can get the compilation token of a
word @i{w} with @code{``@i{w} name>compile}, @code{comp' @i{w}}, or
@code{[comp'] @i{w}}.  The first form first gets the name token of
@i{w} and then accesses the compilation token with
@word{name>compile}.

@node Which semantics do existing words have?, What semantics do normal definitions have?, Where are compilation semantics used?, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@subsection Which semantics do existing words have?

For words built into Gforth, the documentation specifies the semantics.

Most words have default compilation semantics.  For such words (e.g.,
@word{!}, @pxref{Memory Access}) the documentation describes the
interpretation/execution semantics without explicitly labeling it as
such.  The compilation semantics of these words is to compile the
interpretation semantics into the current definition; the stack effect
of performing the default compilation semantics is @code{( -- )}.

Some words have non-default compilation semantics.  This is either
indicated by labels for interpretation, compilation, and/or run-time
in the stack effects (e.g., for @word{IF}, @pxref{Arbitrary control
structures}), or by having separate paragraphs for interpretation,
compilation, and/or run-time in the prose (e.g., for @word{S"},
@pxref{String and character literals}).

@cindex semantics, run-time
@cindex run-time semantics
You may wonder about the run-time semantics mentioned in the previous
paragraphs.  For some words (e.g., @word{if}), the compilation
semantics compiles something that is not the interpretation/execution
semantics.  We (and the standard) describe the behaviour of the code
that these words compile with under the label ``run-time semantics'';
if you see ``run-time'' in a word description (e.g., in its stack
effect), that usually refers to run-time semantics that the
compilation semantics of the word compiles.

Concerning the description of the various semantics, both the standard
and this manual describe the interpretation/execution semantics of
words with default semantics without preceding these semantics with a
label (the label ``execution'' or ``interpretation'' would be
appropriate).  The compilation semantics of such words are the implied
default compilation semantics (@pxref{What semantics do normal
definitions have?}).

For words that have some non-default semantics, the standard specifies
the different semantics of the word in separate subsections, each
preceded with a label (``interpretation:'', ``compilation:'', and, if
necessary, ``execution:'' or ``run-time:''@footnote{In some cases the
standard leaves the subsection for interpretation or compilation
semantics away, and leaves it to the default mechanism to derive those
semantics from execution semantics.}).  This manual often takes a more
informal approach.  The approach taken in this manual may be more
accommodating for everyday use, while the standard approach is more
precise for reasoning about details of the language.


@node What semantics do normal definitions have?, How to define immediate words, Which semantics do existing words have?, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@subsection What semantics do normal definitions have?

Most defining words normally produce words with default interpretation
semantics and default compilation semantics; those that do not (e.g,
@word{synonym} or @word{interpret/compile:}) are documented
appropriately.

@cindex interpretation semantics, default
The interpretation semantics of the newly defined word @i{name} are
described in the ``@i{name} execution:'' part of the description of
the defining word.  Things are a little more complicated for colon
definitions (@pxref{Colon Definitions}) and words using
@code{create}...@code{does>} (@pxref{User-defined defining words using
CREATE}), but again, the description of what these words do is about
the interpretation semantics.

@cindex compilation semantics, default
For a word @i{w} with default compilation semantics, the compilation
semantics are to compile the interpretation semantics.  More formally:
to append the interpretation semantics of @i{w} to the interpretation
semantics of the current definition.  As an example, consider the
definition

@example
: @i{name} ... @i{w} ... ;
@end example

Here the interpretation semantics of @i{w} is appended to the
interpretation semantics of @i{name}.


@node How to define immediate words, How to define combined words, What semantics do normal definitions have?, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@subsection How to define immediate words
@cindex immediate words

You can change the compilation semantics of a word to be the same as
the interpretation semantics with

doc-immediate

A contrived example:

@source
: [foo]
  ." foo" ; immediate

: bar
  [foo] ; \ prints "foo"
bar \ no output
@end source

The @word{immediate} causes @word{[foo]} to perform the interpretation
semantics during the definition of @word{bar} rather than compiling
them.  A convention sometimes (but not always) used for immediate
words is to have their names in brackets, e.g. @word{[']}.

A common use of @word{immediate} is to define macros (@pxref{Macros}).

@cindex compile-only words
The text interpretation of a macro in interpret state is often a
mistake, so you can turn the macro into a @word{compile-only} word
with

doc-compile-only

Example:

@source
: endif
  postpone then ; immediate compile-only

: foo
  if ." true" endif ;

endif \ "warning: endif is compile-only"
@end source

The warning is followed by a stack underflow error because @word{then}
wants to consume an @i{orig} (@pxref{Arbitrary control structures}).

Note that compiling code while the text interpreter is in interpret
state is not a problem in itself, even if a number of words are marked
@word{compile-only}.  A more serious problem is compiling code if the
current definition is not an unfinished colon definition: there is no
way to run the resulting code.  Gforth warns about that even if a word
is not marked compile-only or if you text-interpret it in compile
state:

@source
: compile-+
  postpone + ;

: foo [ compile-+ ] ; \ no warning; interpretation semantics of compile-+
                      
compile-+ \ warning: Compiling outside a definition
if        \ warning: IF is compile-only
          \ warning: Compiling outside a definition
compile-+ \ warning: Compiling outside a definition
then      \ warning: THEN is compile-only
] if      \ warning: Compiling outside a definition
  +       \ warning: Compiling outside a definition
  then
[
@end source

Note that switching to compile state in the last four lines silences
the ``is compile-only'' warnings, because in these lines the
compilation semantics of the words is performed.

Why does @word{then} not produce ``Compiling outside a definition''
warnings in the example above? @word{Then} does not generate any code
by itself, it just changes the target of the code compiled by the
matching @word{if} or @word{ahead}.

@node How to define combined words,  , How to define immediate words, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@subsection How to define combined words
@anchor{Combined words}
@cindex combined word
@cindex semantics, arbitrary combination of interpretation and compilation
@cindex interpretation and compilation semantics, arbitrary combination
@cindex compilation and interpretation semantics, arbitrary combination
@cindex NDCS word

In a few cases (and most of those are a bad idea) you want to define a
word that has some other combination of interpretation and compilation
semantics than words with default compilation semantics or immediate
words; we call such a word a combined word@footnote{Some people call
combined words ``NDCS'', but immediate words also have non-default
compilation semantics}).  The following contrived example shows how
you can define a combined word:

@source
: foo ." foo" ;
: bar ." bar" ;
' foo ' bar interpret/compile: foobar1

foobar1     \ "foo"
] foobar1 [ \ "bar"
@end source

doc-interpret/compile:

There are two kinds of uses for combined words:

One use of combined words is parsing words that should be
copy-pasteable between interpreted and compiled code; these words
should parse at text-interpret time both in their interpretation and
their compilation semantics (like an immediate word), but then should
perform an action in their interpretation semantics and compile that
action in their compilation semantics, like a normal word.  An example
is @word{."} in Gforth:

@source
: ."-int ( 'ccc"' -- )  '"' parse type ;
: ."-comp ( 'ccc"' -- ) '"' parse postpone sliteral postpone type ;

' ."-int ' ."-comp interpret/compile: ."
( interpretation 'ccc"' -- ; compilation 'ccc"' -- ; run-time -- )

." foo"         \ "foo"
: foo ." foo" ;
foo             \ "foo"
@end source

The parsing code is the same in both cases, the action @word{type} is
directly executed in the interpretation semantics and compiled in the
compilation semantics.  The compilation semantics also contains
@code{postpone sliteral} to transfer the parsed string from
text-interpretation time to the run-time of the action.  This kind of
parse/literal/action split with the use of @word{postpone} is typical
for the implementations of the compilation semantics of such parsing
words, and the interpretation semantics consist just of the parse and
the action parts.

@cindex state-smart words (are a bad idea)
We discourage the definition of additional combined words for
copy-pasteability.  They do not work as intended within
@code{]]}...@code{[[} (@pxref{Macros}) and their behaviour is also
confusing in other contexts, e.g., when ticking or @word{postpone}ing
such a word.  A way to achieve copy-pasteability without needing to
define combined words is recognizers (@pxref{Recognizers}).
@code{"foo" type} uses the string recognizer (@pxref{Default
recognizers}) and can be copied and pasted between interpreted code,
compiled code and code inside @code{]]}...@code{[[} without problem.

On the other hand, combined words are still far better than
@anchor{state-smartness}@code{state}-smart
words.@footnote{@code{State}-smart words are immediate words that do
@word{state}-dependent things at run-time.  For a more detailed
discussion of this topic, see M. Anton Ertl,
@cite{@uref{https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/ertl98.ps.gz,@samp{State}-smartness---Why
it is Evil and How to Exorcise it}}, EuroForth '98.}

The other kind of use of combined words is for words like @word{[:}
(@pxref{Quotations}).  These are not parsing words, but
@code{[:}...@code{;]} sequences should be copy-pasteable between
interpreted and compiled code; the whole sequence pushes an xt at its
run-time.  At text-interpret time, it restores the state at the end to
what it was at the start.  Ideally we would find a clean way to
implement all this without needing combined words, but for now the
implementation is pretty messy, including combined words.

Some people also have the idea to use combined words for optimization.
However, the resulting words do not work as intended with
@code{[compile]} (@pxref{Macros}).  Gforth has a better mechanism for
optimization: @code{set-optimizer} (@pxref{User-defined
compile-comma}).

Some people worry about the aesthetics of @word{interpret/compile:}
and have proposed alternative syntaxes, and the following ones are
supported in Gforth:

@source
: foobar2
  ." foo" ;
[: ." bar" ;] set-compsem

foobar2     \ "foo"
] foobar2 [ \ "bar"

: foobar3
  ." foo" ;
compsem:
  ." bar" ;

foobar3     \ "foo"
] foobar3 [ \ "bar"

: foobar4
  ." bar" ;
intsem:
  ." foo" ;
  
foobar4     \ "foo"
] foobar4 [ \ "bar"
@end source

You can use @word{where} (@pxref{Locating uses of a word}) to find out
how rarely which syntax is used in Gforth.

This section describes the creation and use of tokens that represent
words.

* Execution token::             represents execution/interpretation semantics
* Name token::                  represents named words

@end menu

@node Execution token, Name token, Tokens for Words, Tokens for Words
@subsection Execution token

@cindex xt
@cindex execution token
An @dfn{execution token} (@emph{xt}) represents some behaviour of a word.
You can use @code{execute} to invoke the behaviour represented by the
xt and @code{compile,} (@pxref{Macros}) to compile it into the current
definition.  Other uses include deferred words (@pxref{Deferred
Words}).

In particular, there is @emph{the} execution token of a word that
represents its interpretation semantics (@pxref{Interpretation and
Compilation Semantics}).

@cindex prefix @code{`}
@cindex @code{`} prefix
For a named word @i{x}, you can use @code{`@i{x}} to get its execution
token:

@example
5 `. ( n xt )
execute ( )        \ "5"
: foo `. execute ;
5 foo              \ "5"
@end example

@cindex tick (')
However, the tick-recognizer that recognizes the @code{`} prefix is a
Gforth extension, so you may prefer to use the Standard Forth words:

doc-'
doc-[']

These are parsing words (whereas @code{`@i{x}} is treated as a literal
by a recognizer), and you may find the behaviour in interpreted and
compiled code unintuitive:

@example
5 ' .   ( n xt ) 
execute ( )          \ "5"

: foo ['] . ;
5 foo execute        \ "5"

: bar ' dup ;
5 bar . drop execute \ "5"
@end example

@code{'} parses at run-time, so if you put @code{'} in a colon
definition, as in @code{bar}, it does not consume the next word in the
colon definition, but the next word at run-time (i.e., the @code{.} in
the invocation of @code{bar}).  If you want to push the xt of @i{x}
inside a colon definition, write @code{`@i{x}} or @code{['] @i{x}}.

Gforth's @code{`@i{x}}, @code{'} and @code{[']} warn when you use them
on compile-only words, because such usage may be non-portable between
different Forth systems.

You get the xt of the most recently defined word with @word{latestxt}
(@pxref{Anonymous Definitions}).  For words defined using
@word{noname}, this is the usual way of getting a token.

For words defined with @word{:noname}, the definition already pushes
the xt, so you do not need to use @word{latestxt} for
@word{:noname}-defined words.

@example
:noname ." hello" ;
execute
@end example

An xt occupies one cell and can be manipulated like any other cell.

In Standard Forth the xt is just an abstract data type (i.e., defined
by the operations that produce or consume it).  The concrete
implementation (since Gforth 1.0) is the body address (for old
hands: PFA) of the word; in Gforth 0.7 and earlier, the xt was
implemented as code field address (CFA, 2 cells before the PFA).

doc-execute
doc-execute-exit
doc-perform

@code{[Noop]} is sometimes used as a placeholder execution token:

doc-[noop]
doc-noop

@node Name token, Compilation token, Execution token, Tokens for Words
@subsection Name token

@cindex name token (nt)
@cindex nt (name token)
A @dfn{name token} (@i{nt}) represents a word, primarily a named word,
but in Gforth since 1.0 unnamed words have a name token, too.

The name token is a cell-sized abstract data type that occurs as
argument or result of the words below.

The difference between name token and execution token is that an
execution token represents one behaviour, whereas a name token
represents a word and all its properties, in particular its name and
its behaviours (interpretation semantics, compilation semantics,
possibly @code{TO @i{word}} semantics, etc.)

You get the nt of a word @i{x} with @code{``@i{x}} (since Gforth 1.0)
or with

doc-find-name
doc-find-name-in
doc-latest
doc-latestnt
doc->name
doc-xt>name

You can get all the nts in a wordlist with

doc-traverse-wordlist

You can use the nt to access the interpretation and compilation
semantics of a word, its name, and the next word in the wordlist:

doc-name>interpret
doc-name>compile
doc-name>string
doc-id.
doc-.id
doc-compile-only?
doc-obsolete?
doc-name>link

As a usage example, the following code lists all the words in
@code{forth-wordlist} with non-default compilation semantics
(including immediate words):

@example
: ndcs-words ( wid -- )
  [: dup name>compile ['] compile, <> if over id. then 2drop true ;]
  swap traverse-wordlist ;

forth-wordlist ndcs-words
@end example

This code assumes that a word has default compilation semantics if the
xt part of its compilation token is the xt of @code{compile,}.
@c which
@c holds for Gforth.  There are a few standard ways for a Forth system to
@c deviate from this assumption (although it's more likely that a system
@c that deviates gets it wrong and is non-standard).

Since Gforth 1.0 (but not in earlier versions or many other Forth
systems), nameless words (@pxref{Anonymous Definitions}) have nts and
compilation semantics, and @word{name>string} works on them (producing
a zero-length name).  They are not in a wordlist, however.  You can
get the nt of a nameless word with @code{latestnt}.


Since Gforth 1.0, for most words the concrete implementation of their
nt has the same numeric value as the xt that @word{name>interpret}
produces for the nt.  However for word @i{w} that is a synonym, alias,
or is defined with @code{interpret/compile:}, @word{intsem:} etc., the
xt produced by @word{name>interpret} has a different numeric value
than the nt (and using @word{>name} on these xts will not produce the
nt of @i{w}).  Therefore, you cannot use xts and nts interchangeably,
even if you are prepared to write code specific to Gforth 1.0.

@cindex name field address
@cindex NFA
The closest thing to the nt in classic Forth systems like fig-Forth is
the name field address (NFA), but there are significant differences:
in older Forth systems each word has a unique NFA, LFA, CFA and PFA
(in this order, or LFA, NFA, CFA, PFA) and there are words for getting
from one to the next.  By contrast, in Gforth in general there is an
n:1 relation between name tokens and the xt representing
interpretation semantics; i.e., when you pass different nts to
@word{name>interpret}, the result may be the same xt.

Another difference is that the NFA usually points to the start of the
header, whereas the nt in Gforth 1.0 points to the body (and header
fields are accessed with a negative offset).

Moreover, all of the header fields of the old systems correspond to
fields in Gforth, but Gforth 1.0 has a few additional ones
(@pxref{Header fields}).  


@node Compilation token,  , Name token, Tokens for Words
@subsection Compilation token

@cindex compilation token
@cindex ct (compilation token)
The compilation semantics of a word is represented by a
@dfn{compilation token} consisting of two cells: @i{xt1 xt2}.

You get the compilation token of, e.g., @code{if} in a standard way
with @code{name>compile}, e.g., @code{s" if" find-name name>compile},
but there are also parsing words to get the compilation token of a
word:

doc-[comp']
doc-comp'

You can perform the compilation semantics represented by the
compilation token with @code{execute}.  @word{Execute}ing the
compilation token consumes the whole compilation token and there is
possibly an additional stack effect determined by the represented
compilation semantics (e.g., @word{execute}ing the compilation token
of @word{if} pushes an orig).

You can compile the compilation semantics represented by a compilation
token with @code{postpone,}. I.e., @code{``@i{x} name>compile
postpone,} is equivalent to @code{postpone @i{x}}.

doc-postpone,

Implementation: The top cell @i{xt2} of a compilation token @i{xt1
xt2} is an execution token that represents either @code{execute} or
@code{compile,}@footnote{Depending upon the compilation semantics of
the word. If the word has default compilation semantics, @i{xt2} will
represent @code{compile,}. Otherwise (e.g., for immediate words),
@i{xt2} will represent @code{execute}.}  @i{Xt1} is more specific to
the represented word; for most words, it is the xt produced by
@word{name>interpret}, but there are exceptions, e.g., for words
defined with @word{interpret/compile:}.

@node Compiling words, The Text Interpreter, Tokens for Words, Words
@section Compiling words
@cindex compiling words
@cindex macros

In contrast to most other languages, Forth has no strict boundary
between compilation and run-time.  E.g., you can run arbitrary code
between defining words (or for computing data used by defining words
like @code{constant}). Moreover, @code{Immediate}
(@pxref{Interpretation and Compilation Semantics}) and
@code{[}...@code{]} (@pxref{Literals}) allow running arbitrary
code while compiling a colon definition (exception: any dictionary space you allot must be in a different section, @pxref{Sections}).

@menu
* Literals::                    Compiling data values
* Macros::                      Compiling words
@end menu

@node Literals, Macros, Compiling words, Compiling words
@subsection Literals
@cindex Literals

The simplest and most frequent example is to compute a literal during
compilation.  E.g., the following definition prints an array of strings,
one string per line:

@example
: .strings ( addr u -- ) \ gforth
    2* cells bounds U+DO
        cr i 2@@ type
    2 cells +LOOP ;  
@end example

With a simple-minded compiler like Gforth 0.7, this computes @code{2
cells} on every loop iteration.  You can compute this value at compile
time and compile it into the definition like this:

@example
: .strings ( addr u -- ) \ gforth
    2* cells bounds U+DO
        cr i 2@@ type
    [ 2 cells ] literal +LOOP ;  
@end example

@code{[} switches the text interpreter to interpret state (you will
get an @code{ok} prompt if you type this example interactively and
insert a newline between @code{[} and @code{]}), so it performs the
interpretation semantics of @code{2 cells}; this computes a number.
@code{]} switches the text interpreter back into compile state.  It
then performs @code{Literal}'s compilation semantics, which are to
compile this number into the current word.  You can decompile the word
with @code{see .strings} to see the effect on the compiled
code.@footnote{In Gforth 1.0, the compiler performs constant folding,
and @word{see} of the original @word{.strings} will show the same
effect.}

You can also optimize the @code{2* cells} into @code{[ 2 cells ]
literal *} in this way.@footnote{In Gforth 1.0, @code{2 cells *} is
sufficient.}

doc-[
doc-]
doc-literal
doc-lit,
doc-aliteral
doc-]L

There are also words for compiling other data types than single cells as
literals:

doc-2literal
doc-2lit,
doc-fliteral
doc-flit,
doc-sliteral
doc-slit,

@cindex colon-sys, passing data across @code{:}
@cindex @code{:}, passing data across
You might be tempted to pass data from outside a colon definition to
the inside on the data stack.  The straightforward approach to do this
does not work, because @code{:} pushes a colon-sys, making stuff below
unaccessible.  E.g., this does not work:

@example
5 : foo literal ; \ error: "unstructured"
@end example

Instead, you have to pass the value in some other way, e.g., through
the return stack:

@source
5 >r : foo [ r> ] literal ;
@end source

The interpretive use of the return stack is Gforth-specific; the use
of a variable also works on other Forth systems:

@example
variable temp
5 temp !
: foo [ temp @@ ] literal ;
@end example


@node Macros,  , Literals, Compiling words
@subsection Macros
@cindex Macros
@cindex compiling compilation semantics

@code{Literal} and friends compile data values into the current
definition.  You can also write words that compile other words into the
current definition.  E.g.,

@example
: compile-+ ( -- ) \ compiled code: ( n1 n2 -- n )
  POSTPONE + ;

: foo ( n1 n2 -- n )
  [ compile-+ ] ;
1 2 foo .
@end example

This is equivalent to @code{: foo + ;} (@code{see foo} to check this).
What happens in this example?  @code{Postpone} compiles the compilation
semantics of @code{+} into @code{compile-+}; later the text interpreter
executes @code{compile-+} and thus the compilation semantics of +, which
compile (the execution semantics of) @code{+} into
@code{foo}.

doc-postpone

Compiling words like @code{compile-+} are usually immediate
(@pxref{How to define immediate words}) so you do not have to switch
to interpret state to execute them; modifying the last example
accordingly produces:

@example
: [compile-+] ( compilation: --; interpretation: -- )
  \ compiled code: ( n1 n2 -- n )
  POSTPONE + ; immediate

: foo ( n1 n2 -- n )
  [compile-+] ;
1 2 foo .
@end example

You will occasionally find the need to POSTPONE several words;
putting POSTPONE before each such word is cumbersome, so Gforth
provides a more convenient syntax: @code{]] ... [[}.  This
allows us to write @code{[compile-+]} as:

@example
: [compile-+] ( compilation: --; interpretation: -- )
  ]] + [[ ; immediate
@end example

doc-]]

The unusual direction of the brackets indicates their function:
@code{]]} switches from compilation to postponing (i.e., compilation
of compilation), just like @code{]} switches from immediate execution
(interpretation) to compilation.  Conversely, @code{[[} switches from
postponing to compilation, ananlogous to @code{[} which switches from
compilation to immediate execution.

The real advantage of @code{]] }...@code{ [[} becomes apparent when
there are many words to POSTPONE.  E.g., the word
@code{compile-map-array} (@pxref{Advanced macros Tutorial}) can be
written much shorter as follows:

@example
: compile-map-array ( compilation: xt -- ; run-time: ... addr u -- ... )
\ at run-time, execute xt ( ... x -- ... ) for each element of the
\ array beginning at addr and containing u elements
  @{: xt: xt :@}
  ]] cells over + swap ?do
    i @@ xt 1 cells +loop [[ ;

: sum-array ( addr u -- n )
  0 [ ' + compile-map-array ] ;
@end example

If you then say @code{see sum-array}, it shows the following code:

@source
: sum-array
  #0 over + swap ?do
    i @ + #8 +LOOP
;
@end source

In addition to @code{]]}...@code{[[}, this example shows off some
other features:

@itemize

@item
It uses a defer-flavoured (defined with @code{xt:}) local @code{xt};
mentioning such a local inside @code{]]}...@code{[[} results in
@code{compile,}ing the xt in the local, i.e., @code{]] xt [[} is
equivalent to @code{action-of xt compile,}.

@item
Not used in the example, but related to the previous point: For a
normal (value-flavoured) local, using it inside @code{]]}...@code{[[}
compiles the value of the local, i.e., @code{]] x [[} is equivalent to
@code{x ]] literal [[}.

@item
It uses the literal @code{1} inside @code{]]}...@code{[[}.  This
results in @code{postpone}ing the @code{1}, i.e. compiling it when
@code{compile-map-array} is run.  @code{]] 1 [[} is equivalent to
@code{1 ]] literal [[}.

@item
When @code{compile-map-array} is run (while @word{sum-array} is
compiled), @code{1 cells} is compiled and optimized into @code{#8} by
Gforth's constant folding.

@end itemize

Note that parsing words such as @code{s\"} don't parse at postpone
time and therefore not inside @code{]]}...@code{[[}.  Instead of
@code{s\" mystring\n"} you can use the string recognizer and write
@code{"mystring\n"}, which works inside @code{]]}...@code{[[}.
Likewise, the parsing word @code{[']} does not parse inside
@code{]]}...@code{[[} while the recognizer notation starting with
@code{`} works inside @code{]]}...@code{[[}.

But if you prefer to use @code{s\"} (or have a parsing word that has
no recognizer replacement), you can do it by switching back to
compilation:

@example
]] ... [[ s\" mystring\n" ]] sliteral ... [[
@end example

Definitions of @code{]]} and friends in Standard Forth are provided in
@file{compat/macros.fs}.

Immediate compiling words are similar to macros in other languages (in
particular, Lisp).  The important differences to macros in, e.g., C are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
You use the same language for defining and processing macros, not a
separate preprocessing language and processor.

@item
Consequently, the full power of Forth is available in macro definitions.
E.g., you can perform arbitrarily complex computations, or generate
different code conditionally or in a loop (e.g., @pxref{Advanced macros
Tutorial}).  This power is very useful when writing a parser generators
or other code-generating software.

@item
Macros defined using @code{postpone} etc. deal with the language at a
higher level than strings; name binding and other resolutions happen
at macro definition time, so you can avoid the pitfalls of name
collisions that can happen in C macros.  Of course, Forth is a liberal
language and also allows you to define text-based macros using
@word{evaluate} (see below).

@end itemize

You may want the macro to compile a number into a word.  The word to do
it is @code{literal}, but you have to @code{postpone} it, so its
compilation semantics take effect when the macro is executed, not when
it is compiled:

@example
: [compile-5] ( -- ) \ compiled code: ( -- n )
  5 POSTPONE literal ; immediate

: foo [compile-5] ;
foo .
@end example

A more convenient, but less portable way to write @word{[compile-5]}
is:

@source
: [compile-5] ( -- ) \ compiled code: ( -- n )
  ]] 5 [[ ; immediate
@end source

You may want to pass parameters to a macro, that the macro should
compile into the current definition.  If the parameter is a number, then
you can use @code{postpone literal} (similar for other values).

If you want to pass a word that is to be compiled, the usual way is to
pass an execution token and @code{compile,} it:

@example
: twice ( xt -- ) \ compiled code: ... -- ...
  dup compile, compile, ;

: 2+ ( n1 -- n2 )
  [ ' 1+ twice ] ;
@end example

doc-compile,
@c doc-2compile,

A more convenient, but less portable way to write @word{twice} is:

@source
: twice {: xt: xt -- :} \ compiled code: ... -- ...
  ]] xt xt [[ ;
@end source

An alternative that allows you to pass the compilation semantics as
parameters is to use the compilation token (@pxref{Compilation
token}).  The same example in this technique:

@example
: ctwice ( ... ct -- ... ) \ compiled code: ... -- ...
  2dup 2>r execute 2r> execute ;

: 2+ ( n1 -- n2 )
  [ ``1+ name>compile ctwice ] ;
@end example

In particular, you want to pass the compilation token and
@word{execute} it in case of words without interpretation semantics or
with non-default and non-immediate compilation semantics (i.e., not
for @word{1+}).

In the example above @code{2>r} and @code{2r>} ensure that @code{ctwice}
works even if the executed compilation semantics has an effect on the
data stack.

You can also define complete definitions with these words; this provides
an alternative to using @code{does>} (@pxref{User-defined Defining
Words}).  E.g., instead of

@example
: curry+ ( n1 "name" -- )
    CREATE ,
DOES> ( n2 -- n1+n2 )
    @@ + ;
@end example

you could define

@example
: curry+ ( n1 "name" -- )
  \ name execution: ( n2 -- n1+n2 )
  >r : r> POSTPONE literal POSTPONE + POSTPONE ; ;

-3 curry+ 3-
see 3-
@end example

The sequence @code{>r : r>} is necessary, because @code{:} puts a
colon-sys on the data stack that makes everything below it unaccessible.

A more convenient, but less portable way to define @word{curry+} is:

@source
: curry+ ( n1 "name" -- )
  \ name execution: ( n2 -- n1+n2 )
  {: n1 :} : ]] n1 + ; [[ ;
@end source

This way of writing defining words is sometimes more, sometimes less
convenient than using @code{does>} (@pxref{Advanced does> usage
example}).  One advantage of this method is that it can be optimized
better, because the compiler knows that the value compiled with
@code{literal} is fixed, whereas the data associated with a
@code{create}d word can be changed.  But if you use
@code{does>}/@code{set-does>} with @code{set-optimizer}, the resulting
code will be at least as good, and the defined word will consume less
memory.

doc-[compile]
doc-in-colon-def?

Some people argue in favour of @word{evaluate}-based macros like:

@example
: my2dup s" over over" evaluate ; immediate
@end example

We do not recommend using this technique, because it moves a number of
decisions to macro-use time, when the setup may be different than you
intended:

@itemize

@item
The recognizer order may be different.  This will usually not make a
difference, but in case of doubt, you can use @word{rec-meta} to
reduce potential ambiguity.

@item
The search order and the contents of individual wordlists may be
different.  You can use @word{rec-scope} to eliminate the search
order dependency, but there is no easy way to eliminate the changes in
the wordlists, except to avoid @word{evaluate}-based macros
altogether.

@item
@word{State} may be different, and if this influences the behaviour of
the macro, it will be @word{state}-smart (@pxref{state-smartness}).

@item
@word{Base} may be different, potentially changing the meaning of
multi-digit numbers.  Use number prefixes to avoid this problem.

@end itemize

An advantage of an @word{evaluate}-based macros is that you may be
able to use it interpretively, whereas @word{postpone}-based macros
are useful only inside colon definitions and other macros.  Our
recommended alternative is to instead use an inline definition
(@pxref{Inline Definitions}) or define a colon definition and an
optimizer for it (e.g., see the @code{my2dup} examples in
@ref{User-defined compile-comma}).


@c ----------------------------------------------------------
@node The Text Interpreter, The Input Stream, Compiling words, Words
@section  The Text Interpreter
@cindex interpreter - outer
@cindex text interpreter

@cindex interpret state
@cindex compile state
The text interpreter processes Forth source code, and performs the
semantics of the words in the source code.  The text interpreter works
on Forth source code coming from the standard input (the @dfn{user
input device} in Forth standard terminology), from a file (through
@word{included} and friends), from @word{evaluate}, or from a
@word{load}ed block.

@cindex outer interpreter
@cindex inner interpreter and text interpreter
The text interpreter is also called the outer interpreter, in contrast
to the inner interpreter of traditional Forth implementations which
interprets the threaded code that is the output of the Forth compiler
on these implementations; many Forth systems nowadays compile to
native code and have no inner interpreter.  Concerning Gforth's
approach, @pxref{Engine}.

@cindex lines and the text interpreter
The text interpreter works line by line (using @word{refill}).
Therefore, most parsing words (e.g., @word{'} and @word{s"}) only try
to find their parsed arguments in the current line; if a word parses
across line boundaies, that is stated explicitly in the documentation
of the word.  However, a block is interpreted like one line, their
division into ``lines'' is just for display purposes; @word{Evaluate}
interprets the string as a whole.  The current line/block/string is
available to programs through @word{source}, and its content is valid
until the current line is changed; it has to be treated as read-only
region.

Within a line, the text interpreter parses for white-space-delimited
words (with @word{parse-name}).  The text interpreter's position
within the line is stored in @word{>in}, and by changing @word{>in}, a
program can change where the text interpreter or parsing word
continues to parse.

The text interpreter then tries to recognize the word with one of the
recognizers in the system recognizer sequence.  On success, this
produces a @emph{translation} (a translation token and additional
data), which represents the recognized word on the stack, as far as
the text interpreter is concerned (@pxref{Defining recognizers}).

It then performs the interpretation, compilation, or postponing action
of the translation, depending on the state of the text interpreter: Is
it inside @code{]]}...@code{[[}? If not, what is the value of
@word{state}?  E.g., when a word from the search order is recognized,
and the text interpreter is in compile state, the compilation
semantics of this word will be performed.  This translation action may
perform additional parsing, e.g., when the recognizer has recognized a
parsing word.  If no recognizer recognizes the word, the text
interpreter @word{throw}s -13 (``undefined word'').

The text interpreter then continues to parse, recognize, and translate
words.  At the end of the line, it @word{refill}s and continues with
the next line.  At the end of an input source (e.g., at the end of a
file), the text interpreter returns to its caller, and that caller
(e.g., @word{included}) restores the previous input stream before
returning itself.

If an exception is not caught earlier, the same unnesting of input
streams and the associated calls are performed.  If not @word{catch}
intervenes, the @word{throw} is eventually caught by the system.  In
Gforth, the system then prints an error message with a backtrace of
both the call stack and the stack of nested input streams
(@pxref{Error messages}).  In interactive mode, Gforth then calls a
text interpreter for the user input device, while in scripting mode
(while processing OS command-line arguments, @pxref{Scripting mode})
Gforth then terminates with a non-zero exit code.

You can read about this in more detail in @ref{Input Sources}.

@subsection Interpret/Compile states
@cindex Interpret/Compile states

A standard program is not permitted to change @code{state}
explicitly. However, it can change @code{state} implicitly, using the
words @code{[} and @code{]}. When @code{[} is executed it switches
@code{state} to interpret state, and therefore the text interpreter
starts interpreting. When @code{]} is executed it switches @code{state}
to compile state and therefore the text interpreter starts
compiling. The most common usage for these words is for switching into
interpret state and back from within a colon definition; this technique
can be used to compile a literal (for an example, @pxref{Literals}) or
for conditional compilation (for an example, @pxref{Interpreter
Directives}).

doc-state

@c This is a bad example: It's non-standard, and it's not necessary.
@c However, I can't think of a good example for switching into compile
@c state when there is no current word (@code{state}-smart words are not a
@c good reason).  So maybe we should use an example for switching into
@c interpret @code{state} in a colon def. - anton
@c nac-> I agree. I started out by putting in the example, then realised
@c that it was non-ANS, so wrote more words around it. I hope this
@c re-written version is acceptable to you. I do want to keep the example
@c as it is helpful for showing what is and what is not portable, particularly
@c where it outlaws a style in common use.

@c anton: it's more important to show what's portable.  After we have done
@c that, we can also show what's not.  In any case, I have written a
@c section Compiling Words which also deals with [ ].

@c  !! The following example does not work in Gforth 0.5.9 or later.

@c  @code{[} and @code{]} also give you the ability to switch into compile
@c  state and back, but we cannot think of any useful Standard application
@c  for this ability. Pre-ANS Forth textbooks have examples like this:

@c  @example
@c  : AA ." this is A" ;
@c  : BB ." this is B" ;
@c  : CC ." this is C" ;

@c  create table ] aa bb cc [

@c  : go ( n -- ) \ n is offset into table.. 0 for 1st entry
@c    cells table + @@ execute ;
@c  @end example

@c  This example builds a jump table; @code{0 go} will display ``@code{this
@c  is A}''. Using @code{[} and @code{]} in this example is equivalent to
@c  defining @code{table} like this:

@c  @example
@c  create table ' aa COMPILE, ' bb COMPILE, ' cc COMPILE,
@c  @end example

@c  The problem with this code is that the definition of @code{table} is not
@c  portable -- it @i{compile}s execution tokens into code space. Whilst it
@c  @i{may} work on systems where code space and data space co-incide, the
@c  Standard only allows data space to be assigned for a @code{CREATE}d
@c  word. In addition, the Standard only allows @code{@@} to access data
@c  space, whilst this example is using it to access code space. The only
@c  portable, Standard way to build this table is to build it in data space,
@c  like this:

@c  @example

These words are usually used in interpret state; typically to control
which parts of a source file are processed by the text
interpreter. There are only a few Standard Forth words, but Gforth
supplements these with a rich set of immediate control structure words
to compensate for the fact that the non-immediate versions can only be
used in compile state (@pxref{Control Structures}). Typical usage:

@example
[undefined] \G [if]

@node Recognizers, Text Interpreter Hooks, Interpreter Directives, The Text Interpreter
@subsection Recognizers
@cindex recongizers

The recognizer concepts factor the central part of the text
interpreter: The processing of one word after its name has been
parsed.

The words and descriptions in this section are those that have found
consensus in the standardization committee and will probably be
standardized.  There are also additional words implemented by Gforth
and described in this section.  Currently this manual does not tell
which words are planned to be standardized and which are not.  If you
want to know that, see
@cite{@uref{https://forth-standard.org/proposals/recognizer-committee-proposal-2025-09-11?hideDiff#reply-1535,Recognizer
committee proposal 2025-09-11}}.

Most programs just use the text interpreter as-is, and you can skip
this chapter completely in this case, but if you are curious,
@pxref{Default recognizers}.  The next level of recognizer usage is to
change which of the existing recognizers are used and in what order
(@pxref{Recognizer order}).

You may also want to define a new recognizer; a recognizer produces an
on-stack representation of the recognized string, called a
@dfn{translation}, which contains a @dfn{translation token}.  You can
use predefined translation tokens for defining your recognizer
(@pxref{Defining recognizers}), or
first define a new tranlation token (@pxref{Defining translation
tokens}).  Finally, you may want to process the translation
(@pxref{Performing translation actions}).

@subsubsection Default recognizers
@cindex Recognizers normal usage

Type @word{recs} to find out with which recognizers are
currently being used by Gforth.  When invoked in a colon definition
after defining a local, the output of @word{recs} is (at the
time of this writing):

@code{rec-name ( rec-local search-order ( Forth Forth Root ) )
rec-scope rec-number rec-float rec-complex rec-string rec-to rec-dtick
rec-tick rec-body rec-env rec-meta}

Here the notation @i{name ( name1 ... namen )} indicates that @i{name}
is a recognizer sequence that contains the recognizers @i{name1
... namen}.

The recognizers in this sequence are:

@table @asis

@item @word{rec-name}
Recognizes locals and words in the search order.

@item @word{rec-local}
Recognizes locals.

@item @word{search-order}
Recognizes words in the search order.  This is shown as recognizer
sequence, because the wordlists (@pxref{Word Lists}) themselves are
also recognizers: They implement the recognizer interface
(@pxref{Defining recognizers}) in
addition to working with @word{find-name-in}.

@item @word{rec-scope}
Recognizes @code{@i{voc1}:@i{voc2}:..@i{vocn}:@i{word}}, where
@i{voc1} is a vocabulary in the search order, @i{voc2} is a vocabulary
found in @i{voc1}, and so on, until @i{word} is found in @i{vocn}.
The result behaves as if @i{word} had been found directly in the
search order.  Example: @code{environment:max-n}.

@item @word{rec-number}
Single-cell integers (@code{#-15}, @code{$-f}), characters
(@code{'A'}), and double-cell integers @code{#-15.}, with or without
number prefixes (@pxref{Integer and character literals}).

@item @word{rec-float}
Floating-point numbers (@code{1e}, @pxref{Floating-point number and
complex literals})

@item @word{rec-complex}
Complex numbers (@code{1e+2ei}, @pxref{Floating-point number and
complex literals})

@item @word{rec-string}
Strings (@code{"abc"}, @pxref{String and environment variable literals}).

@item @word{rec-to}
Recognizes @code{->@i{v}} (equivalent to @code{to @i{v}}),
@code{+>@i{v}} (equivalent to @code{+to @i{v}}), and @code{'>@i{v}}
(equivalent to @code{addr @i{v}}), where @i{v} is a value-flavoured
word (@pxref{Values}).  Also recognizes @code{@@>@i{d}} (equivalent to
@code{action-of @i{d}}), and @code{=>@i{d}} (equivalent to @code{is
@i{d}}), where @i{d} is a defer-flavoured word (@pxref{Deferred
Words}).

@item @word{rec-dtick}
Recognizes @code{``@i{word}} and produces the name token of @i{word}
(@pxref{Literals for tokens and addresses}).

@item @word{rec-tick}
Recognizes @code{`@i{word}} and produces the execution token of @i{word}
(@pxref{Literals for tokens and addresses}).

@item @word{rec-body}
Recognizes @code{<@i{word}>} for the body address of @i{word} and
@code{<@i{word}+@i{num}>} for an offset @i{num} from the body address
of @i{word} (@pxref{Literals for tokens and addresses}).

@item @word{rec-env}
Recognizes @code{$@{@i{env}@}} for the string contained at run-time in
the environment variable @i{env} @pxref{String and environment
variable literals}).

@item @word{rec-meta}
Recognizes @code{@i{rec}?@i{string}}, e.g., @code{float?1.}.
@code{Rec-@i{rec}} is a recognizer found in the search order (e.g.,
@word{rec-float}), and this recognizer then tries to recognize
@i{string} (e.g, @code{1.}), and the result becomes the result of
@word{rec-meta}.  This may be useful in cases where you want to use a
specific recognizer, e.g., to deal with conflicts.

@end table

The order of the recognizers is significant, because they are tried
from left to right, and the first recognizer that recognizes a word is
actually used.  E.g., if you define a local @code{b}, it will
supersede Gforth's predefined word @word{b}.

In most cases, however, recognizers are designed to avoid matching the
same strings as other recognizers.  E.g., @code{rec-env} (the
environment variable recognizer) requires braces to avoid a conflict
with the number recognizer when recognizing environment variables like
@code{ADD}; i.e., @word{rec-env} recognizes @word{${ADD}}, while
@word{rec-number} recognizes @word{$ADD}.

There are a few cases where Gforth's recognizers can recognize the
same string, however:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Word names can be anything, so they can conflict with any other
recognizer (and locals and the search order are searched before other
recognizers).

However, there are no conflicts of Gforth-defined words with decimal
numbers prefixed with @code{#} or hex numbers prefixed with @code{$},
so it is a good practice to use these prefixes (it's also a good idea
to make sure that the right @word{base} is used).  An older practice
(before number prefixes were introduced) was to prefix hex numbers
with @code{0}.

In the code bases we have looked at, starting words with @code{'}
(quote aka tick) is much more common than starting them with @code{`}
(backquote aka backtick), so the recognizers for the xt and the nt use
@code{`} to reduce the number of conflicts.

@item
Both the integer recognizer @code{rec-number} and the floating-point
recognizer @code{rec-float} recognize, e.g., @code{1.}.  Because
@code{rec-number} is (by default) earlier, @code{1.} is recognized as a
double-cell integer.  If you change the recognizer order to use
@code{rec-float} first, @code{1.} is recognized as a floating-point
number, but loading code written in Standard Forth may behave in a
non-standard way.

In any case, it's a good practice to avoid that conflict in your own
code as follows: Always write double-cell integers with a number
prefix, e.g., @code{#1.}; and always write floating-point numbers with
an @code{e}, e.g., @code{1e}.

@item
We have seen a few word names that start with @code{->}.  You can
avoid a conflict by using @code{to myvalue} or @code{to?->myvalue}
(the latter works with @code{postpone}).

@end itemize

Note that most Forth systems do not support all the recognizers we
describe above, but @code{rec-name rec-number rec-float}
are relatively common (even if a system uses a hard-coded text
interpreter instead of the flexible recognizer system).

You can use @code{locate} (@pxref{Locating source code definitions}) to
determine which recognizer recognizes a piece of source code.  E.g.:

@example
locate float?1.
@end example

will show that @code{rec-meta} recognizes @code{float?1.}.  However,
if the recognizer recognizes a dictionary word (e.g., the scope
recognizer), @word{locate} will show that word.

Wordlists are also recognizers, as can be seen by the search order
being shown as recognizer sequence containing the wordlists, .  A
wordlist recognizes the words that it contains.  Just @word{execute}
the wordlist-id, and it will behave as a recognizer:

@source
"dup" forth-wordlist execute
@end source

produces the same result as

@source
"dup" rec-name
@end source

Actually, @word{rec-name} searches all wordlists in the search order;
with the default search order, that finds the @word{dup} in
@word{forth-wordlist}.

doc-recs

All recognizers produce the translation @word{translate-none} if they
do not recognize the string.  This is not mentioned every time in the
following descriptions.

@node Recognizer order, Defining recognizers, Default recognizers, Recognizers
@subsubsection Recognizer order

You may prefer to use a different recognizer sequence, but with (some
of the) existing recognizers.  You can use the following words for
that:

doc-rec-forth
doc-rec-sequence:
doc-get-recs
doc-set-recs

You probably don't want to create a new recognizer sequence every time
you want to change the system recognizer sequence.  There are several
ways to change an existing recognizer sequence:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Put one or more @word{defer}red words in a recognizer sequence, and
change the recognizer in this word later.  If you do not want such a
deferred word to recognize anything for now, put @word{rec-none} in
it.

@item
Use @word{set-recs} on the recognizer sequence, possibly after getting
the current sequence with @word{get-recs} and modifying it.

@item
The body of a recognizer sequence is a @word{stack}
(@pxref{User-defined Stacks}), and you can use the words for
manipulating stacks on it.  In particular, if you add a recognizer
with @word{>stack}, that recognizer will be tried first; if you add it
with @word{>back}, it will be tried last.

@end itemize

doc-rec-none

Here is an example of adding @word{rec-none} as last recognizer to
the system recognizers:

@source

\ alternative
' rec-none action-of rec-forth >body >back

@node Defining recognizers, Defining translation tokens, Recognizer order, Recognizers
@subsubsection Defining recognizers
@cindex recognizer, stack effect
@cindex translation
@cindex translation token

A @dfn{recognizer} is a Forth word with the stack effect @code{(
@i{c-addr u -- translation} )}.  @i{c-addr u} describes the string to
be recognized.  The returned @dfn{translation} is an abstract, but
transparent data type: On the top of stack, there is a single-cell
@dfn{translation token}.  If the recognizer does not recognize the
string, it returns the translation token @word{translate-none}.  If it
does recognize the string, it returns a translation with a different
translation token.  The translation token also identifies how many
other stack items the translation contains and how the translation
will be processed later.

E.g., when you perform

@example
"5" rec-number
@end example

it pushes @code{5 translate-cell} on the stack, which is a translation
with the translation token @word{translate-cell}.

You typically write a recognizer as ordinary colon definition that
examines the string in some way, and then pushes the appropriate
translation.  E.g., a simple variant of @word{rec-tick} can be
implemented as follows:

@source
: rec-tick ( addr u -- translation )
    2dup "`" string-prefix? if
        1 /string find-name dup if
            name>interpret translate-cell exit then
        drop translate-none exit then
    rec-none ;
@end source            

The only appropriate use of a translation is to pass it to one of the
words for performing translation actions (@pxref{Performing
translation actions}).

A number of translation tokens already exist in Gforth and can be used
in a recognizer you write.  If none of them is appropriate for your
recognizer, read the next section about defining your own translation
tokens.

@cindex translation-token words, stack effect
The system-defined translation-token words are documented as removing
some stack items and pushing a complete translation on the stack,
e.g., for @word{translate-cell} @code{( x -- translation )}.  This
makes the documentation uniform and avoids cumbersome descriptions.
However, actually the current translation-token words just push a
cell-sized translation token on the stack (for @word{translate-cell}:
@code{( -- translate-cell )}), and, combined with the additional stack
items (for @word{translate-cell}: @code{( x -- x translate-cell )}),
the result is a translation (for @word{translate-cell}: @code{( x --
translation )}).

@c !! move this further down?
The text interpreter passes the output of the recognizer to a
translation action (@pxref{Performing translation actions}).  Every
translation action removes the translation from the stack, then may
perform additional parsing, and finally performs the interpreting
run-time of the translation token, or the compiling run-time, or the
postponing run-time.

For each system-defined translation token we specify the interpreting
run-time explicitly.  Unless otherwise specified, the compiling
run-time compiles the interpreting run-time.  Unless otherwise
specified, the postponing run-time compiles the compiling run-time.

In the @word{rec-tick} example above, if the recognizer recognizes,
say, @code{`dup}, it returns @i{xt-dup translate-cell}.  If the text
interpreter then performs the compiling action, that action first
removes this translation (these two cells), and compiles code that
pushes @i{xt-dup}.

doc-translate-name
doc-translate-cell
doc-translate-dcell
doc-translate-float
doc-translate-complex 
doc-translate-string
doc-scan-translate-string
doc-translate-env
doc-translate-to
@c doc-translate-local
@c doc-translate-word

One way to write a recognizer @i{r} is to call a recognizer (for the
whole input of @i{r} or a substring) that recognizes more strings
(e.g., @code{rec-forth}), and then look at the result to see if
something was recognized that @i{r} actually deals with.

E.g., the actual implementation of @word{rec-tick} passes its input
without the prefix @samp{`} to @word{rec-forth} and checks whether the
resulting translation-token is @i{nt translate-name}, then converts
@i{nt} to @i{xt}, and replaces @i{translate-name} with
@i{translate-cell}.  The benefit of this approach compared to our
example implementation above is that, e.g., @word{`environment:max-n}
works, where @word{rec-scope} recognizes @word{environment:max-n}.

The specific check for an nt used in @word{rec-tick} is
@word{rec-forth-nt?}; it is implemented on top of the more
general @word{rec-filter}.

doc-rec-filter
doc-rec-forth-nt?


@node  Defining translation tokens, Performing translation actions, Defining recognizers, Recognizers
@subsubsection Defining translation tokens

Before you define a translation token, you should think about the
interpreting run-time, compiling run-time, and postponing run-time
that the corresponding actions should perform for translations with
this translation token.  Also, you should think about whether the
translation actions should perform additional scanning (like
@word{scan-translate-string}).

You then need to define three words, one for the interpreting action,
one for the compiling action, and one for the postponing action.

Each of these words will eventually be called after removing the
translation token from the stack (but the remainder of the translation
is still on the stack(s)).  It should remove this remainder, perform
the additional scanning (if any), and then perform the appropriate
run-time.

Once you have these three words, you can define a translation token by
passing the xts of these words to

doc-translate:

To make this a little more concrete, here is an implementation for
@word{translate-cell}:

@source
' noop                       ( x -- x )                             \ int-xt
' lit,                       ( compilation: x -- ; run-time: -- x ) \ comp-xt
:noname lit, postpone lit, ; ( postponing: x -- ;  run-time: -- x ) \ post-xt
translate: translate-cell
@end source

If a recognizer recognizes something as a single-cell literal @i{x},
it pushes @i{x} and then calls @word{translate-cell}.  Later the text
interpreter (or @word{postpone} or some other consumer of
translations) removes the translation token and executes one of the
three xts above (depending on what translation action is desired).

When the interpretation semantics is needed, @i{int-xt} is executed,
and @i{x} stays on the stack.

For the compilation semantics, @i{x} is compiled into the current
definition as literal.

For postponing, more time levels are involved: at text-interpretation
time (when the recognizer runs and the translation token action is performed)
the current definition is @i{d1}.  When @i{d1} runs, the current
definition is @i{d2}@footnote{If there is no current definition when
something is compiled, Gforth outputs a warning.}.  The @i{post-xt} of
the @word{translate-cell} implementation above first compiles @i{x}
into @i{d1} and also compiles @word{lit,} into @i{d1} (that's the
@code{postpone lit,} part).  When @i{d1} runs, it pushes @i{x} and
then the @word{lit,} compiles @i{x} into @i{d2}.

Many literal translation tokens follow this scheme.

A translation token that is quite different is @word{translate-name}.
Here's an implementation:

@source
: name-intsem ( ... nt -- ... )
  name>interpret execute-exit ;
: name-compsem ( ... nt -- ... )
  name>compile execute-exit ;
: name-compcompsem ( nt -- )
  lit, postpone name-compsem ;
' name-intsem ' name-compsem ' name-compcompsem translate: translate-name
@end source

@word{Name-intsem} performs the interpretation semantics of @i{nt}, by
getting the xt of the interpretation semantics and executing it.  Here
@word{execute-exit} is used, in order for return-stack words to work
(that's a Gforth 1.0 feature).  Also, in Gforth 1.0 all words have
interpretation semantics, so the result of @word{name-interpret} is
not tested for 0.

@word{Name-compsem} performs the compilation semantics of @i{nt}.

@word{Name-compcompsem} compiles the compilation semantics of @i{nt}.
This is achieved by compiling @i{nt} and @word{name-compsem} into the
current definition @i{d1}.  When @i{d1} runs, the result performs the
compilation semantics of @i{nt} at that time.

@node Performing translation actions,  , Defining translation tokens, Recognizers
@subsubsection Performing translation actions

There are the following words for performing the various translation token
actions:

doc-interpreting
doc-compiling
doc-postponing
doc-?rec-found

Their typical use is in a text interpreter.  A simple text interpreter
could look like this:

@source
: myinterpret ( -- )
  \ refill happens outside
  begin
    parse-name dup while
      forth-recognize ?rec-found state @ if compiling else interpreting then
  repeat
  2drop ;
@end source

This text interpreter itself does not deal with postponing; @word{]]}
can be implemented as a text interpreter that performs the postponing:

@source
: ]] ( -- )
  \ works only within a line
  begin
    parse-name dup 0= abort" [[ missing"
    2dup "[[" str= 0= while
      forth-recognize ?rec-found postponing
   repeat
   2drop ; immediate

@node The Input Stream, Word Lists, The Text Interpreter, Words
@section The Input Stream
@cindex input stream

@c !! integrate this better with the "Text Interpreter" section
The text interpreter reads from the input stream, which can come from
several sources (@pxref{Input Sources}).  Some words, in particular
defining words, but also words like @code{'}, read parameters from the
input stream instead of from the stack.

Such words are called parsing words, because they parse the input
stream.  Parsing words are hard to use in other words, because it is
hard to pass program-generated parameters through the input stream.
They also usually have an unintuitive combination of interpretation and
compilation semantics when implemented naively, leading to various
approaches that try to produce a more intuitive behaviour
(@pxref{Combined words}).

It should be obvious by now that parsing words are a bad idea.  If you
want to implement a parsing word for convenience, also provide a factor
of the word that does not parse, but takes the parameters on the stack.
To implement the parsing word on top if it, you can use the following
words:

doc-parse
doc-string-parse
doc-parse-name
doc-parse-word
doc-name
doc-word
doc-refill

If you have to deal with a parsing word that does not have a
non-parsing factor, you can use @code{execute-parsing} to pass a
string to it:

doc-execute-parsing

Example:

@example
5 s" foo" ' constant execute-parsing
\ equivalent to
5 constant foo
@end example

A definition of this word in Standard Forth is provided in
@file{compat/execute-parsing.fs}.

If you want to run a parsing word on a file, the following word should

@node Word Lists, Number conversion, The Input Stream, Words
@section Word Lists
@cindex word lists
@cindex header space

A wordlist is a list of named words; you can add new words and look up
words by name (and you can remove words in a restricted way with
markers).  Every named (and @code{reveal}ed) word is in one wordlist.

@cindex search order stack
The text interpreter searches the wordlists present in the search
order (a stack of wordlists, @pxref{User-defined Stacks}), from the
top to the bottom.  Within each wordlist, the search starts
conceptually at the newest word; i.e., if two words in a wordlist have
the same name, the newer word is found.

@cindex compilation word list
New words are added to the @dfn{compilation wordlist} (aka current
wordlist).

@cindex wid
A word list is identified by a cell-sized word list identifier (@i{wid})
in much the same way as a file is identified by a file handle. The
numerical value of the wid has no (portable) meaning, and might change
from session to session.

The Standard Forth ``Search order'' word set is intended to provide a set of
low-level tools that allow various different schemes to be
implemented. Gforth also provides @code{vocabulary}, a traditional Forth
word.  @file{compat/vocabulary.fs} provides an implementation in Standard
Forth.

@node Why use word lists?, Wordlist and vocabulary usage, Word Lists, Word Lists
@subsection Why use word lists?
@cindex word lists - why use them?

Here are some reasons why people use wordlists:

@itemize @bullet

@c anton: Gforth's hashing implementation makes the search speed
@c independent from the number of words.  But it is linear with the number
@c of wordlists that have to be searched, so in effect using more wordlists
@c actually slows down compilation.

@c @item
@c To improve compilation speed by reducing the number of header space
@c entries that must be searched. This is achieved by creating a new
@c word list that contains all of the definitions that are used in the
@c definition of a Forth system but which would not usually be used by
@c programs running on that system. That word list would be on the search
@c list when the Forth system was compiled but would be removed from the
@c search list for normal operation. This can be a useful technique for
@c low-performance systems (for example, 8-bit processors in embedded
@c systems) but is unlikely to be necessary in high-performance desktop
@c systems.

@item
To prevent a set of words from being used outside the context in which
they are valid. Two classic examples of this are an integrated editor
(all of the edit commands are defined in a separate word list; the
search order is set to the editor word list when the editor is invoked;
the old search order is restored when the editor is terminated) and an
integrated assembler (the op-codes for the machine are defined in a
separate word list which is used when a @code{CODE} word is defined).

@item
To organize the words of an application or library into a user-visible
set (in @code{forth-wordlist} or some other common wordlist) and a set
of helper words used just for the implementation (hidden in a separate
wordlist).  This keeps @code{words}' output smaller, separates
implementation and interface, and reduces the chance of name conflicts
within the common wordlist.

@item
To prevent a name-space clash between multiple definitions with the same
name. For example, when building a cross-compiler you might have a word
@code{IF} that generates conditional code for your target system. By
placing this definition in a different word list you can control whether
the host system's @code{IF} or the target system's @code{IF} get used in
any particular context by controlling the order of the word lists on the
search order stack.

@end itemize

The downsides of using wordlists are:

@itemize

@item
Debugging becomes more cumbersome, because you have to use the scope
recognizer or put the wordlist in the search order in order to refer
to a word in a wordlist.  Neither @word{locate} nor (currently)
@word{see} show the names of words with their wordlist or vocabulary.

@item
Name conflicts worked around with wordlists are still there, and you
have to arrange the search order carefully to get the desired results;
if you forget to do that, you get hard-to-find errors (as in any case
where you read the code differently from the compiler; @code{see} can
help seeing which of several possible words the name resolves to in such
cases).  @code{See} displays just the name of the words, not what
wordlist they belong to, so it might be misleading.  Using unique names
is a better approach to avoid name conflicts.

@subsection Wordlist and vocabulary usage
@cindex Vocabularies, usage
@cindex wordlist usage
@cindex vocabularies vs. wordlists

@c !! maybe divide into wordlist and vocabulary part and put it before
@c the doc-...
If you have an existing wordlist in constant @word{foo-wordlist} and
want to push it on the search order, here's how you do it:

@source
foo-wordlist >order
... \ code that may use words from foo-wordlist
previous
\ now the search order is back to where we started
@end source

If instead you have a vocabulary @word{foo}, the same task can be
accomplished as follows:

@source
also foo
... \ code that may use words from foo
previous
\ now the search order is back to where we started
@end source

Also, if you need only one or a few words from @word{foo}, you can use
the scope recognizer (@word{rec-scope}, @pxref{Default recognizers})
and write @code{foo:@i{word}}.  Currently the scope recognizer only
uses vocabularies for the scope, not wordlists.

A common usage is to define implementation words (which would be
private in other programming languages) in a separate wordlist, and
(public) interface words in a wordlist for public words (usually
@word{forth-wordlist}).  This can be achieved as follows:

@source
wordlist constant foo-wordlist \ the implementation wordlist
get-current ( wid )
foo-wordlist >order definitions
\ foo-wordlist is now visible and definitions go into it
... \ define implementation words
( wid ) set-current
\ foo-wordlist is visible, but definitions go into wid
... \ define interface words
previous
\ search order and current wordlist are back to where we started
@end source

The same can be done with vocabularies as follows:

@source
vocabulary foo \ the implementation vocabulary
get-current ( wid )
also foo definitions
\ foo is now visible and definitions go into it
... \ define implementation words
( wid ) set-current
\ foo is visible, but definitions go into wid
... \ define interface words
previous
\ search order and current wordlist are back to where we started
@end source

If you want to define just one word in a given wordlist, you can do it
as follows:

@source
foo-wordlist in-wordlist : bar ... ;
@end source

For vocabularies, the corresponding usage is:

@source
in foo : bar ... ;
@end source

This section is about conversion between numbers and strings.  For

In addition to the number-to-string conversion words mentioned in this
section, you can also convert numbers to strings by using a number
output word (@pxref{Simple numeric output}, @pxref{Floating-point
output}), and outputting the result in a string with
@word{>string-execute} (@pxref{String words}).

@subsection Base and integer decimal point
@cindex number conversion, @code{base}
@cindex integer conversion, @code{base}

By default, the number base used for integer number conversion is
given by the contents of the variable @code{base}.  @word{Base}
affects both input integer conversion (unless a number prefix is used,
@pxref{Literals in source code}) and output integer conversion (unless
a base-specific word such as @word{h.} or @word{dec.} is used,
@pxref{Simple numeric output}, @pxref{Integer to string conversion}).  In
Gforth, non-decimal @word{base} disables floating-point conversion.

Note that a lot of confusion can result from unexpected values of
@code{base}.  If you change @code{base} anywhere, make sure to save
the old value and restore it afterwards; better yet, use
@code{base-execute}, which does this for you.

In general I recommend keeping @code{base} decimal; For dealing with
the popular non-decimal bases, use number prefixes for inputting them
(@pxref{Literals in source code}) and @word{h.} and
@word{base-execute} for outputting them.

@cindex number conversion - traps for the unwary
@noindent
Number conversion has a number of traps for the unwary:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A . in or at the end of a number by default indicates a double number, not a
floating-point number.
@item
Input FP conversion does not happen if @word{base} is non-decimal.
@item
You cannot determine the current number base using the code sequence
@code{base @@ .} -- the number base is always 10 in the current number
base. Instead, use something like @code{base @@ dec.}
@item
There is a word @code{bin} but it does @i{not} set the number base!
(@pxref{General files}).
@item
Standard Forth requires the @code{.} of a double-precision number to be the
final character in the string.  Gforth allows the @code{.} to be
anywhere.
@item
The input integer conversion process does not check for overflow.
Instead, you get a value in the range of the result integer type
(single or double cell) that is congruent with the input number modulo
the number of values in the integer type (e.g., modulo 2^128 for
doubles with 64-bit cells).
@end itemize

Words affected by @word{base} are @word{rec-number} (@pxref{Default
recognizers}), @word{>number} (@pxref{String to number conversion}),
and the words described in the sections @ref{Simple numeric output},
and @ref{Integer to string conversion}. @word{Rec-number} sets
@word{dpl}.

For higher-level integer-to-number conversion (with number prefixes,

You can alternatively use @word{rec-float} (@pxref{Default

@word{>float} is used for known-FP-data possibly coming from another
program with funny output syntax and is therefore more liberal in
accepting input, while the strings that the text interpreter passes to
@word{rec-float} are not all intended to be interpreted as FP numbers,
and therefore @word{rec-float} is more restrictive.

@cindex formatted numeric output
@cindex pictured numeric output
@cindex numeric output - formatted
@cindex integer to string conversion

@c old section name:
@anchor{Formatted numeric output}
Forth uses a technique called @dfn{pictured numeric output} for
formatted printing of integers.  In this technique, digits are
extracted from the number (using the current output radix defined by
@code{base}, @pxref{Base and integer decimal point}), converted to
ASCII codes and prepended to a string that is built in the pictured
numeric output buffer, aka @word{hold} buffer (total size, including
all nestings and the @word{word} buffer, is at most 104 bytes on a
32-bit machine, @pxref{core-idef, Implementation-defined options,
Implementation-defined options}). Arbitrary characters can be
prepended to the string during the extraction process. The completed
string is specified by an address and length and can be manipulated
(@code{TYPE}ed, copied, modified) under program control.

All of the integer output words described in the previous section
(@pxref{Simple numeric output}) are implemented in Gforth using pictured
numeric output.

Three important things to remember about pictured numeric output:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It always operates on double-precision numbers; to display a
single-precision number, convert it first (for ways of doing this
@pxref{Double precision}).
@item
It always treats the double-precision number as though it were
unsigned. The examples below show ways of printing signed numbers.
@item
The string is built up from right to left; least significant digit first.
@end itemize

Standard Forth supports a single output buffer (aka @word{hold} area) that
you empty and initialize with @code{<#} and for which you get the
result string with @code{#>}.

Gforth additionally supports nested usage of this buffer, allowing,
e.g., to nest output from the debugging tracer @code{~~} inside code
dealing with the hold area: @code{<<#} starts a new nest, @code{#>}
produces the result string, and @code{#>>} unnests: the hold area for
the nest is reclaimed, and @code{#>} now produces the string for the
next-outer nest.  All of Gforth's higher-level numeric output words
use @code{<<#} ... @code{#>} ... @code{#>>} and can be nested inside
other users of the hold area.

@section Environmental Queries
@cindex environmental queries

Forth-94 introduced the idea of ``environmental queries'' as a way
for a program running on a system to determine certain characteristics
of the system.  The Standard specifies a number of strings that might
be recognised by a system, and a way of querying them:

doc-environment?

Note that, while the documentation for (e.g.)
@code{ADDRESS-UNIT-BITS} shows that it returns one cell on the stack,
querying it using @code{environment?}  will return an additional item;
the @code{true} flag that shows that the string was recognised; so for
querying @code{ADDRESS-UNIT-BITS} the stack effect of
@code{environment?} may be @code{( c-addr u -- n true )} or @code{(
c-addr u -- false )}.  The support of various environmental queries by
systems (even on hardware with enough memory) is somewhat lackluster,
so you have to take the possibility of @word{environment?} returning
false seriously.

@c Get all the words in environment-wordlist:
@c gforth -e "environment-wordlist wordlist-words cr bye"|sed 's/[ ]/\n/g'|sed '/^$/d'|tac

Several environmental queries deal with the system's limits:

doc-ADDRESS-UNIT-BITS
doc-MAX-CHAR
doc-/COUNTED-STRING
doc-/HOLD
doc-/PAD
doc-CORE
doc-CORE-EXT
doc-FLOORED
doc-MAX-N
doc-MAX-U

doc-stack-cells
doc-floating-stack
doc-#locals
doc-wordlists
doc-max-float
doc-xchar-encoding
doc-max-xchar
doc-xchar-maxmem

Several environmental queries are there for determining the presence of
the Forth-94 version of a wordset; they all have the stack effect
@code{( -- f )} if the string is present (so the @code{environment?}
stack effect for these queries is @code{( c-addr u -- false / f true
)}.

@code{block
block-ext

file
file-ext
floating
floating-ext
locals
locals-ext
memory-alloc
memory-alloc-ext
tools
tools-ext
search-order
search-order-ext
string
string-ext}

These wordset queries were rarely used and implemented, so Forth-2012
did not introduce a way to query for the Forth-2012 variants of the
wordsets.  Instead, the idea is that you use @code{[defined]}
(@pxref{Interpreter Directives}) for checking the presence of
individual standard words instead.

Forth-200x (a group that works on the next standard; the documents
that they produce are also called Forth-200x) defines extension
queries for the extension proposals once they finish changing (CfV
stage), so programs using these proposals can check whether a system
has them, and maybe load the reference implementation (if one exists).
If @code{environment?} finds such a query, then the corresponding
proposal on @url{www.forth200x.org} is implemented on the system (but
the absence tells you nothing, as usual with @code{environment?}).
These queries have the stack effect @code{( -- )}, which means that
for them @code{environment?} has the stack effect @code{( c-addr u --
false / true )}, which is more convenient than that of wordset
queries.  A number of these proposals have been incorporated into
Forth-2012.  The extension queries are also not particularly popular
among Forth system implementors, so going for @code{[defined]} may be
the better approach.  Anyway, Gforth implements the following
extension queries:

@code{X:2value
X:buffer
X:deferred
X:defined
X:ekeys
X:escaped-strings
X:extension-query
X:fp-stack
X:ftrunc
X:fvalue
X:locals
X:n-to-r
X:number-prefixes

X:required
X:s-escape-quote
X:s-to-f
X:structures
X:synonym
X:text-substitution
X:throw-iors
X:traverse-wordlist

In addition, Gforth implements the following Gforth-specific queries:

doc-gforth
doc-os-class
doc-os-type

The Standard requires that the header space used for environmental queries
be distinct from the header space used for definitions.

Typically, a Forth system supports environmental queries by creating a
set of definitions in a wordlist that is @i{only} used for
environmental queries; that is what Gforth does. There is no Standard
way of adding definitions to the set of recognised environmental
queries, but in Gforth and other systems that use the wordlist
mechanism, the wordlist used to honour environmental queries can be
manipulated just like any other word list.

@comment TODO Document the standard strings or note where they are documented herein

Here are some examples of using environmental queries:

@example
s" address-unit-bits" environment? 0=
[IF]
     cr .( environmental attribute address-units-bits unknown... ) cr
[ELSE]
     drop \ ensure balanced stack effect

@node Forth source files, General files, Files, Files
@subsection Forth source files
@cindex including files
@cindex Forth source files

The simplest way to interpret the contents of a file is to use one of
these two equivalent syntaxes:

@example
include mysource.fs
s" mysource.fs" included
@end example

You usually want to include a file only if it is not included already
(by, say, another source file). In that case, you can replace @word{include} with @word{require}:

@example
require mysource.fs
s" mysource.fs" required
@end example

@cindex stack effect of included files
@cindex including files, stack effect
It is good practice to write your source files such that interpreting
them does not change the stack. Source files designed in this way can
be used with @code{required} and friends without complications. For
example, assume that including @file{foo.fs} has the stack effect
@code{( u -- u )} (@i{u} might be a configuration parameter, such as a
buffer size).  Then you can use it with @word{require}:

@example
1024 require foo.fs drop
@end example

If @word{require} actually includes @file{foo.fs}, the 1024 will be on
the stack at the end, just like if @word{require} does nothing.  With
such parameters to required files, you have to ensure that the first
@code{require} fits for all uses (i.e., @code{require} the file early
in the master load file).

Another alternative is to pass configuration parameters by defining
words (often constants) for them.

@subsection Redirection
@cindex Redirection
@cindex Input Redirection
@cindex Output Redirection

You can redirect the output of @code{type} and @code{emit} and all the
words that use them (all output words that don't have an explicit
target file) to an arbitrary file with the @code{outfile-execute},
used like this:

@example
: some-warning ( n -- )
    cr ." warning# " . ;

: print-some-warning ( n -- )
    ['] some-warning stderr outfile-execute ;
@end example

After @code{some-warning} is executed, the original output direction
is restored; this construct is safe against exceptions.  Similarly,
there is @code{infile-execute} for redirecting the input of @code{key}
and its users (any input word that does not take a file explicitly).

doc-outfile-execute
doc-outfile-id
doc-infile-execute
doc-infile-id

If you do not want to redirect the input or output to a file, you can
also make use of the fact that @code{key}, @code{emit} and @code{type}
are deferred words (@pxref{Deferred Words}).  However, in that case
you have to worry about the restoration and the protection against
exceptions yourself; also, note that for redirecting the output in
this way, you have to redirect both @code{emit} and @code{type}.

@node Search Paths,  , Directories, Files
@subsection Search Paths
@cindex path for @code{included}
@cindex file search path

@cindex search path for files

If you specify an absolute filename (i.e., a filename starting with
@file{/} or @file{~}, or with @file{:} in the second position (as in
@samp{C:...})) for @code{included} and friends, that file is included
just as you would expect.

If the filename starts with @file{./}, this refers to the directory that
the present file was @code{included} from.  This allows files to include
other files relative to their own position (irrespective of the current
working directory or the absolute position).  This feature is essential
for libraries consisting of several files, where a file may include
other files from the library.  It corresponds to @code{#include "..."}
in C. If the current input source is not a file, @file{.} refers to the
directory of the innermost file being included, or, if there is no file
being included, to the current working directory.

For relative filenames (not starting with @file{./}), Gforth uses a
search path similar to Forth's search order (@pxref{Word Lists}). It
tries to find the given filename in the directories present in the path,
and includes the first one it finds. There are separate search paths for
Forth source files and general files.  If the search path contains the
directory @file{.}, this refers to the directory of the current file, or
the working directory, as if the file had been specified with @file{./}.

Use @file{~+} to refer to the current working directory (as in the
@code{bash}).

Forth search path words:

doc-open-path-file
doc-file>path
doc-clear-path
doc-also-path
doc-.path
doc-path+
doc-path=

Here's an example of creating a custom search path:

mypath path= /lib|/usr/lib \ assign initial directories
mypath path+ /usr/local/lib \ append directory
mypath .path \ output:"/lib /usr/lib /usr/local/lib"

@node Blocks, Other I/O, Files, Words
@section Blocks
@cindex I/O - blocks
@cindex blocks

Traditionally, Forth has been used on systems without an operating
system@footnote{This is called @dfn{native}, whereas Forth running on
top of an OS is called @dfn{hosted}.}, and in particular without a
file system.  Forth provides a mechanism, called @dfn{blocks}, for
accessing mass storage on such systems.

A block is a 1024-byte data area, which can be used to hold data or
Forth source code. No structure is imposed on the contents of the
block. A block is identified by its number; blocks are numbered
contiguously from 1 to an implementation-defined maximum.

A typical system that used blocks but no operating system might use a
single floppy-disk drive for mass storage, with the disks formatted to
provide 256-byte sectors. Blocks would be implemented by assigning the
first four sectors of the disk to block 1, the second four sectors to
block 2 and so on, up to the limit of the capacity of the disk. The disk
would not contain any file system information, just the set of blocks.

@cindex blocks file
On systems that do provide file services, blocks are typically
implemented by storing a sequence of blocks within a single @dfn{blocks
file}.  The size of the blocks file will be an exact multiple of 1024
bytes, corresponding to the number of blocks it contains. This is the
mechanism that Gforth uses.

@cindex @file{blocks.fb}
Only one blocks file can be open at a time. If you use block words without
having specified a blocks file, Gforth defaults to the blocks file
@file{blocks.fb}. Gforth uses the Forth search path when attempting to
locate a blocks file (@pxref{Source Search Paths}).

@cindex block buffers
When you access blocks, Gforth uses a number of @dfn{block buffers} as
intermediate storage.  The behaviour of the block buffers is analogous
to that of a cache.  Each block buffer has three states:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Unassigned
@item
Assigned-clean
@item
Assigned-dirty
@end itemize

Initially, all block buffers are @i{unassigned}. In order to access a
block, the block (specified by its block number) must be assigned to a
block buffer.

The assignment of a block to a block buffer is performed by
@code{block} or @code{buffer}. Use @code{block} when you wish to
modify the existing contents of a block. Use @code{buffer} don't care
about the existing contents of the block and just want to overwrite
it.

Once a block has been assigned to a block buffer using @code{block} or
@code{buffer}, that block buffer becomes the @i{current block
buffer}. Data may only be manipulated (read or written) within the
current block buffer.

When the contents of the current block buffer has been modified, it is
necessary, @emph{before calling @code{block} or @code{buffer} again}, to
either abandon the changes (by doing nothing) or mark the block as
changed (assigned-dirty), using @code{update}. Using @code{update} does
not change the blocks file; it simply changes a block buffer's state to
@i{assigned-dirty}.  The block will be written implicitly when it's
buffer is needed for another block, or explicitly by @code{flush} or
@code{save-buffers}.

@code{Flush} writes all @i{assigned-dirty} blocks back to the
blocks file on disk. Leaving Gforth with @code{bye} also performs a
@code{flush}.

When a block is used for storing source code, it is traditional to
display the contents as 16 lines each of 64 characters (with
@word{list}).  A block provides a single, continuous stream of input
(for example, it acts as a single parse area) -- there are no
end-of-line characters within a block, and no end-of-file character at
the end of a block. There are two consequences of this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The last character of one line A is contiguous with the first
character of the following line B, so you need to either put at least
one blank at the end of A, or at the start of B in order to separate
the last word of A from the first word of B.
@item
The word @code{\} -- comment to end of line -- requires special
treatment; in the context of a block it causes all characters until the
end of the current 64-character ``line'' to be ignored.
@end itemize

In Gforth, when you use @code{block} with a non-existent block number,
the current blocks file will be extended to the appropriate size and the
block buffer will be initialised with spaces.

Gforth includes a simple block editor (type @code{use blocked.fb 0 list}
for details) but doesn't encourage the use of blocks; the mechanism is
only provided for backward compatibility.

Common techniques that are used when working with blocks include:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A screen editor that allows you to edit blocks without leaving the Forth
environment.
@item
Shadow screens; where every code block has an associated block
containing comments (for example: code in odd block numbers, comments in
even block numbers). Typically, the block editor provides a convenient
mechanism to toggle between code and comments.
@item
Load blocks; a single block (typically block 1) contains a number of
@code{thru} commands which @code{load} the whole of the application.
@end itemize

See Frank Sergeant's Pygmy Forth to see just how well blocks can be
integrated into a Forth programming environment.

If you don't want to worry about whether to use @code{.( hello)} or

what you usually want (but is less portable to other Forth systems).

@noindent
As an example, consider the following program:

my-word        \ prints "text-2text-4"

." text-5"     \ prints "text-5"

@end example

If you want to understand why this code behaves this way, the
explanations for this concrete example are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Messages @code{text-1} and @code{text-3} are displayed because
@code{.(} is an immediate word; it behaves in the same way whether it
is used inside or outside a colon definition (@pxref{Interpretation
and Compilation Semantics}).
@item
Message @code{text-2} is not displayed during the definition of
@word{my-word}, because the text interpreter performs the compilation
semantics for @code{."}.  Later the interpretation semantics of
@word{my-word} are performed, and they perform the run-time semantics
of @word{."}.
@item
Message @code{text-4} is not displayed during the definition of
@word{my-word}, because @code{"text-4"} (see @word{rec-string},
@word{translate-string}) performs the compiling run-time for the
string, which compiles the interpreting run-time (@pxref{Defining
recognizers}) into @word{my-word}, and @word{type} compiles the
interpretation/execution semantics of @word{type} into @word{my-word}.
Later the interpretation semantics of @word{my-word} are performed,
and they perform the compiled interpreting run-time and interpretation
semantics.
@item
Message @code{text-5} is displayed because of Gforth's added interpretation
semantics for @code{."}.

Message @code{text-6} is displayed because @code{"text-6" type} is

Depending on whether you use a light or dark background, some colors
tend to lead to too-low contrast.  Therefore, Gforth supports
adjusting its colors to the background with @word{light-mode} (for
light background) and @word{dark-mode} for dark background.  

Gforth tries to select the right mode automatically, but that does not
always work.  In order to avoid having to set the theme every time you
enter Gforth, you can set the environment variable @code{GFORTH_INIT}
before starting Gforth.  Possible values are: @code{light},
@code{dark}, @code{uncolored}, or @code{auto} (default).

In addition, you can specify an input theme (separated from the
mode theme by a space in @code{GFORTH_INIT} if both are present):
@code{magenta} or @code{default} (default).

The key identifiers for cursor keys are:

doc-k-left
doc-k-right
doc-k-up
doc-k-down
doc-k-home
doc-k-end
doc-k-prior
doc-k-next
doc-k-insert
doc-k-delete

The key identifiers for function keys (aka keypad keys) are:

doc-k-f1
doc-k-f2
doc-k-f3
doc-k-f4
doc-k-f5
doc-k-f6
doc-k-f7
doc-k-f8
doc-k-f9
doc-k-f10
doc-k-f11
doc-k-f12

Note that @code{k-f11} and @code{k-f12} are not as widely available.

You can combine these key identifiers with masks for various shift keys:

doc-k-shift-mask
doc-k-ctrl-mask
doc-k-alt-mask

There are a number of keys that have ASCII values, and therefore are
unlikely to be reported as special keys, but the combination of these
keys with shift keys may be reported as a special key:

doc-k-enter
doc-k-backspace
doc-k-tab

Moreover, there are the following key codes for keys and other events:

doc-k-winch
doc-k-pause
doc-k-mute
doc-k-volup
doc-k-voldown
doc-k-sel
doc-k-eof

Note that, even if a Forth system has @code{ekey>fkey} and the key
identifier words, the keys are not necessarily available or it may not
necessarily be able to report all the keys and all the possible
combinations with shift masks.  Therefore, write your programs in such
a way that they are still useful even if the keys and key combinations
cannot be pressed or are not recognized.

Examples: Older keyboards often do not have an F11 and F12 key.  If
you run Gforth in an xterm, the xterm catches a number of combinations
(e.g., @key{Shift-Up}), and never passes it to Gforth.  Finally,
Gforth currently does not recognize and report combinations with
multiple shift keys (so the @key{shift-ctrl-left} case in the example
above would never be entered).

Gforth recognizes various keys available on ANSI terminals (in MS-DOS
you need the ANSI.SYS driver to get that behaviour); it works by
recognizing the escape sequences that ANSI terminals send when such a
key is pressed.  If you have a terminal that sends other escape
sequences, you will not get useful results on Gforth.  Other Forth
systems may work in a different way.

Gforth also provides a few words for outputting names of function
keys:

doc-fkey.
doc-simple-fkey-string

@subsection String input from the terminal

In addition to using Gforth in pipes created by other processes

If you write to a pipe, Gforth can throw a @code{broken-pipe-error}; if
you don't catch this exception, Gforth will catch it and exit, usually
silently (@pxref{Gforth in pipes}).  Since you probably do not want
this, you should wrap a @code{catch} or @code{try} block around the code
from @code{open-pipe} to @code{close-pipe}, so you can deal with the
problem yourself, and then return to regular processing.

Comma-separated values (CSV) are a popular text format to interchange

The usual way to pass arguments to Gforth programs on the command line
is via the @option{-e} option, e.g.

@example
gforth -e "123 456" foo.fs -e bye
@end example

However, you may want to interpret the command-line arguments directly.
In that case, you can access the (image-specific) command-line arguments
through @code{next-arg}:

doc-next-arg

Here's an example program @file{echo.fs} for @code{next-arg}:

@example
: echo ( -- )
    begin
        next-arg 2dup 0 0 d<> while
            type space
    repeat
    2drop ;

echo cr bye

This can be invoked with

@example
gforth echo.fs hello world

and it will print

The similarity of locals definitions with stack comments is intended. A
locals definition often replaces the stack comment of a word. The order
of the locals corresponds to the order in a stack comment and everything
after the @code{--} is really a comment.

@cindex types of locals
@cindex locals types
The name of the local may be preceded by a type specifier, e.g.,
@code{F:} for a floating point value:

\ complex multiplication
 Ar Br f* Ai Bi f* f-
 Ar Bi f* Ai Br f* f+ ;

@cindex flavours of locals

Gforth currently supports cells (@code{W:}, @code{W^}), doubles
(@code{D:}, @code{D^}), floats (@code{F:}, @code{F^}), characters
(@code{C:}, @code{C^}), and xts (@code{xt:})
in several flavours:

@table @dfn

@item value-flavoured
(@pxref{Values}) A value-flavoured local (defined with @code{W:},
@code{D:} etc.) produces its value and can be changed with @code{TO}
and @code{+TO}.  Also, if you put @word{addressable:} in front of the
locals definition, you can get its address with @code{ADDR}
(@pxref{How long do locals live?}).

@item variable-flavoured
(@pxref{Variables}) A variable-flavoured local (defined with @code{W^}
etc.)  produces its address (@pxref{How long do locals live?}).  E.g.,
the standard word @code{emit} can be defined in terms of @code{type}
like this:

@source
: emit {: C^ char* -- :}
    char* 1 type ;
@end source

@item defer-flavoured
(@pxref{Deferred Words}) A defer-flavoured local (defined with
@code{XT:}) @code{execute}s the xt; you can use @code{action-of}
(@pxref{Deferred Words}) to get the xt out of a defer-flavoured local.
If the local is defined with @code{addressable: xt:}, you can use
@code{addr} to get the address where the xt is stored (@pxref{How long
do locals live?}).  E.g., the standard word @code{execute} can be
defined with a defer-flavoured local like this:

@example
: execute @{: xt: x -- :@}
  x ;
@end example

@end table

@cindex default type of locals
@cindex locals, default type
A local without type specifier is a @code{W:} local.  You can also

@cindex locals initialization
@cindex initialization of locals
All flavours of locals are initialized with values from the data or
(for FP locals) FP stack, with the exception being locals defined
behind @code{|}: Gforth initializes them to 0; some Forth systems leave
them uninitialized.

@cindex data structure locals
Gforth supports the square bracket notation for local buffers and data
structures.  These locals are similar to variable-flavored locals, the
size is specified as a constant expression.  A declaration looks
@code{@i{name}[ @i{size} ]}.  The Forth expression @code{@i{size}} is
evaluated during declaration, it must have the stack effect @code{( --
+n )}, giving the size in bytes.  The square bracket @code{[} is part
of the defined name.

Local data structures are initialized by copying @i{size} bytes from
an address passed on the stack; uninitialized local data structures
(after @code{|} in the declaration) are not erased, they just contain
whatever data there was on the locals stack before.

Example:

@example
begin-structure test-struct
  field: a1
  field: a2
end-structure

: test-local @{: foo[ test-struct ] :@}
    foo[ a1 !  foo[ a2 !
    foo[ test-struct dump ;
@end example

Gforth allows defining locals everywhere in a colon definition. This

some Forth systems they may not even be words (and the standard
documents them under @word{{:}, not as separate word).  @word{}} is
also in @code{locals-types}.

@node Where are locals visible by name?, How long do locals live?, Locals definition words, Gforth locals
@subsubsection Where are locals visible by name?
@cindex locals visibility
@cindex visibility of locals
@cindex scope of locals

Basically, the answer is that locals are visible where you would expect
it in block-structured languages, and sometimes a little longer. If you
want to restrict the scope of a local, enclose its definition in
@code{SCOPE}...@code{ENDSCOPE}.


doc-scope
doc-endscope


These words behave like control structure words, so you can use them
with @code{CS-PICK} and @code{CS-ROLL} to restrict the scope in
arbitrary ways.

If you want a more exact answer to the visibility question, here's the
basic principle: A local is visible in all places that can only be
reached through the definition of the local@footnote{In compiler
construction terminology, all places dominated by the definition of the
local.}. In other words, it is not visible in places that can be reached
without going through the definition of the local. E.g., locals defined
in @code{IF}...@code{THEN} are visible until the @code{THEN}, locals
defined in @code{BEGIN}...@code{UNTIL} are visible after the
@code{UNTIL} (until, e.g., a subsequent @code{ENDSCOPE}).

The reasoning behind this solution is: We want to have the locals
visible as long as it is meaningful. The user can always make the
visibility shorter by using explicit scoping. In a place that can
only be reached through the definition of a local, the meaning of a
local name is clear. In other places it is not: How is the local
initialized at the control flow path that does not contain the
definition? Which local is meant, if the same name is defined twice in
two independent control flow paths?

This should be enough detail for nearly all users, so you can skip the
rest of this section. If you really must know all the gory details and
options, read on.

In order to implement this rule, the compiler has to know which places
are unreachable. It knows this automatically after @code{AHEAD},
@code{AGAIN}, @code{EXIT} and @code{LEAVE}; in other cases (e.g.,
after most @code{THROW}s), you can use the word @code{UNREACHABLE} to
tell the compiler that the control flow never reaches that place. If
@code{UNREACHABLE} is not used where it could, the only consequence is
that the visibility of some locals is more limited than the rule above
says. If @code{UNREACHABLE} is used where it should not (i.e., if you
lie to the compiler), you can produce code whose behaviour is best
determined by looking at the implementation (which may change).

doc-unreachable


Another problem with this rule is that at @code{BEGIN}, the compiler
does not know which locals will be visible on the incoming
back-edge. All problems discussed in the following are due to this
ignorance of the compiler (we discuss the problems using @code{BEGIN}
loops as examples; the discussion also applies to @code{?DO} and other
loops). Perhaps the most insidious example is:
@example
AHEAD
BEGIN
  x
[ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
  @{: x :@}
  ...
UNTIL
@end example

This should be legal according to the visibility rule. The use of
@code{x} can only be reached through the definition; but that appears
textually below the use.

From this example it is clear that the visibility rules cannot be fully
implemented without major headaches. Our implementation treats common
cases as advertised and the exceptions are treated in a safe way: The
compiler makes a reasonable guess about the locals visible after a
@code{BEGIN}; if it is too pessimistic, the
user will get a spurious error about the local not being defined; if the
compiler is too optimistic, it will notice this later and issue a
warning. In the case above the compiler would complain about @code{x}
being undefined at its use. You can see from the obscure examples in
this section that it takes quite unusual control structures to get the
compiler into trouble, and even then it will often do fine.

If the @code{BEGIN} is reachable from above, the most optimistic guess
is that all locals visible before the @code{BEGIN} will also be
visible after the @code{BEGIN}. This guess is valid for all loops that
are entered only through the @code{BEGIN}, in particular, for normal
@code{BEGIN}...@code{WHILE}...@code{REPEAT} and
@code{BEGIN}...@code{UNTIL} loops and it is implemented in our
compiler. When the branch to the @code{BEGIN} is finally generated by
@code{AGAIN} or @code{UNTIL}, the compiler checks the guess and
warns the user if it was too optimistic:
@example
IF
  @{: x :@}
BEGIN
  \ x ? 
[ 1 cs-roll ] THEN
  ...
UNTIL
@end example

Here, @code{x} lives only until the @code{BEGIN}, but the compiler
optimistically assumes that it lives until the @code{THEN}. It notices
this difference when it compiles the @code{UNTIL} and issues a
warning. The user can avoid the warning, and make sure that @code{x}
is not used in the wrong area by using explicit scoping:
@example
IF
  SCOPE
  @{: x :@}
  ENDSCOPE
BEGIN
[ 1 cs-roll ] THEN
  ...
UNTIL
@end example

Since the guess is optimistic, there will be no spurious error messages
about undefined locals.

If the @code{BEGIN} is not reachable from above (e.g., after
@code{AHEAD} or @code{EXIT}), the compiler cannot even make an
optimistic guess, as the locals visible after the @code{BEGIN} may be
defined later.

It pessimistically assumes that all locals are visible that were
visible at the latest place outside any control structure (i.e., where
nothing is on the control-flow stack).  This means that in:

@example
: foo
  IF @{: z :@} THEN
  @{: x :@}
  AHEAD
    BEGIN
      ( * )
    [ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
    @{: y :@}
    ...
  UNTIL ;
@end example

At the place marked with @code{( * )}, @code{x} is visible, but
@code{y} is not (although, according to the reachability rule it
should); @code{z} is not and should not be visible there.

However, you can use @code{ASSUME-LIVE} to make the compiler assume
that the same locals are visible at the BEGIN as at the point where
the top control-flow stack item was created.


doc-assume-live


@noindent
E.g.,
@example
IF
  @{: x :@}
  AHEAD
    ASSUME-LIVE
    BEGIN
      x
    [ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
    ...
  UNTIL
THEN
@end example

Here @code{x} would not be visible at the use of @code{x}, because its
definition is inside a control structure, but by using ASSUME-LIVE the
programmer tells the compiler that the locals visible at the
@code{AHEAD} should be visible at the @code{BEGIN}.

Other cases where the locals are defined before the @code{BEGIN} can be
handled by inserting an appropriate @code{CS-ROLL} before the
@code{ASSUME-LIVE} (and changing the control-flow stack manipulation
behind the @code{ASSUME-LIVE}).

Cases where locals are defined in a @code{BEGIN} loop and should be
visible in that loop before the definition can only be handled by
rearranging the loop. E.g., the ``most insidious'' example above can
be arranged into:
@example
BEGIN
  @{: x :@}
  ... 0=
WHILE
  x
REPEAT
@end example

@node How long do locals live?, Locals programming style, Where are locals visible by name?, Gforth locals
@subsubsection How long do locals live?
@cindex locals lifetime
@cindex lifetime of locals

The right answer for the lifetime question would be: A local lives at
least as long as it can be accessed. For a regular value-flavoured
local this means: until the end of its visibility. However, an
addressable value-flavoured or variable-flavoured local could be
accessed through its address far beyond its visibility
scope. Ultimately, this would mean that such locals would have to be
garbage collected. Since this entails un-Forth-like implementation
complexities, we adopted the same cowardly solution as some other
languages (e.g., C): The local lives only as long as it is visible;
afterwards its address is invalid (and programs that access it
afterwards are erroneous).

@node Locals programming style, Locals implementation, How long do locals live?, Gforth locals
@subsubsection Locals programming style
@cindex locals programming style
@cindex programming style, locals

The freedom to define locals anywhere has the potential to change
programming styles dramatically. In particular, the need to use the
return stack for intermediate storage vanishes. Moreover, all stack
manipulations (except @code{PICK}s and @code{ROLL}s with run-time
determined arguments) can be eliminated: If the stack items are in the
wrong order, just write a locals definition for all of them; then
write the items in the order you want.

This seems a little far-fetched and eliminating stack manipulations is
unlikely to become a conscious programming objective. Still, the number
of stack manipulations will be reduced dramatically if local variables
are used liberally (e.g., compare @code{max} (@pxref{Gforth locals}) with
a traditional implementation of @code{max}).

This shows one potential benefit of locals: making Forth programs more
readable. Of course, this benefit will only be realized if the
programmers continue to honour the principle of factoring instead of
using the added latitude to make the words longer.

@cindex single-assignment style for locals
Using @code{TO} can and should be avoided.  Without @code{TO},
every value-flavoured local has only a single assignment and many
advantages of functional languages apply to Forth. I.e., programs are
easier to analyse, to optimize and to read: It is clear from the
definition what the local stands for, it does not turn into something
different later.

E.g., a definition using @code{TO} might look like this:
@example
: strcmp @{: addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- n :@}
 u1 u2 min 0
 ?do
   addr1 c@@ addr2 c@@ -
   ?dup-if
     unloop exit
   then
   addr1 char+ TO addr1
   addr2 char+ TO addr2
 loop
 u1 u2 - ;
@end example
Here, @code{TO} is used to update @code{addr1} and @code{addr2} at
every loop iteration. @code{strcmp} is a typical example of the
readability problems of using @code{TO}. When you start reading
@code{strcmp}, you think that @code{addr1} refers to the start of the
string. Only near the end of the loop you realize that it is something
else.

This can be avoided by defining two locals at the start of the loop that
are initialized with the right value for the current iteration.
@example
: strcmp @{: addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- n :@}
 addr1 addr2
 u1 u2 min 0 
 ?do @{: s1 s2 :@}
   s1 c@@ s2 c@@ -
   ?dup-if
     unloop exit
   then
   s1 char+ s2 char+
 loop
 2drop
 u1 u2 - ;
@end example
Here it is clear from the start that @code{s1} has a different value
in every loop iteration.

@node Locals implementation,  , Locals programming style, Gforth locals
@subsubsection Locals implementation
@cindex locals implementation
@cindex implementation of locals

@cindex locals stack
Gforth uses an extra locals stack. The most compelling reason for this
is that the return stack is not float-aligned; using an extra stack
also eliminates the problems and restrictions of using the return
stack as locals stack. Like the other stacks, the locals stack grows
toward lower addresses. A few primitives allow an efficient
implementation; you should not use them directly, but they appear in
the output of @code{see}, so they are documented here:

doc-@localn
doc-f@localn
doc-!localn
doc-lp+n
doc-lp+!
doc->l
doc-f>l

See also @word{lp@}, @word{lp!} (@pxref{Stack pointer manipulation}).

In addition to these primitives, some specializations of these
primitives for commonly occurring inline arguments are provided for
efficiency reasons, e.g., @code{@@local0} as specialization of @code{0
@@localn}.

Combinations of conditional branches and @code{lp+!#} like
@code{?branch-lp+!#} (the locals pointer is only changed if the branch
is taken) are provided for efficiency and correctness in loops.

A special area in the dictionary space is reserved for keeping the
local variable names. @code{@{:} switches the dictionary pointer to this
area and @code{:@}} switches it back and generates the locals
initializing code. @code{W:} etc.@ are normal defining words. This
special area is cleared at the start of every colon definition.

@cindex word list for defining locals
A special feature of Gforth's dictionary is used to implement the
definition of locals without type specifiers: every word list (aka
vocabulary) has its own methods for searching etc. (@pxref{Word
Lists}). For the present purpose we defined a word list with a special
search method: When it is searched for a word, it actually creates
that word using @code{W:}. @code{@{:} changes the search order to
first search the word list containing @code{:@}}, @code{W:} etc., and
then the word list for defining locals without type specifiers.  This
implementation was designed before Gforth acquired recognizers; for a
reimplementation we would use recognizers.

The lifetime rules support a stack discipline within a colon
definition: The lifetime of a local is either nested with other locals
lifetimes or it does not overlap them.

At @code{BEGIN}, @code{IF}, and @code{AHEAD} no code for locals stack
pointer manipulation is generated. Between control structure words
locals definitions can push locals onto the locals stack. @code{AGAIN}
is the simplest of the other three control flow words. It has to
restore the locals stack depth of the corresponding @code{BEGIN}
before branching. The code looks like this:
@format
current-locals-size dest-locals-size - @code{lp+!}
@code{branch} <begin>
@end format

@code{UNTIL} is a little more complicated: If it branches back, it
must adjust the stack just like @code{AGAIN}. But if it falls through,
the locals stack must not be changed. The compiler generates the
following code:
@format
@code{?branch-lp+!#} <begin> current-locals-size @minus{} dest-locals-size
@end format
The locals stack pointer is only adjusted if the branch is taken.

@code{THEN} can produce somewhat inefficient code:
@format
current-locals-size dest-locals-size - @code{lp+!}
<orig target>:
orig-locals-size new-locals-size - @code{lp+!}
@end format
The second @code{lp+!#} adjusts the locals stack pointer from the
level at the @i{orig} point to the level after the @code{THEN}. The
first @code{lp+!#} adjusts the locals stack pointer from the current
level to the level at the orig point, so the complete effect is an
adjustment from the current level to the right level after the
@code{THEN}.  This effect happens e.g., if there is an @word{ELSE} and
the code before the @word{ELSE} defines locals, and they have a
different size than those after the @word{ELSE}.  In general we
recommend not to work around this shortcoming (except in
performance-critical code).  We intend to eliminate this shortcoming
at some point.

@cindex locals information on the control-flow stack
@cindex control-flow stack items, locals information
In a conventional Forth implementation a dest control-flow stack entry
is just the target address and an orig entry is just the address to be
patched. Our locals implementation adds a word list to every orig or dest
item. It is the list of locals visible (or assumed visible) at the point
described by the entry. Our implementation also adds a tag to identify
the kind of entry, in particular to differentiate between live and dead
(reachable and unreachable) orig entries.

A few unusual operations have to be performed on locals word lists:

doc-common-list
doc-sub-list?
doc-list-size


Several features of our locals word list implementation make these
operations easy to implement: The locals word lists are organised as
linked lists; the tails of these lists are shared, if the lists
contain some of the same locals; and the address of a name is greater
than the address of the names behind it in the list.

Another important implementation detail is the variable
@code{dead-code}. It is used by @code{BEGIN} and @code{THEN} to
determine if they can be reached directly or only through the branch
that they resolve. @code{dead-code} is set by @code{UNREACHABLE},
@code{AHEAD}, @code{EXIT} etc., and cleared at the start of a colon
definition, by @code{BEGIN} and usually by @code{THEN}.

Counted loops are similar to other loops in most respects, but
@code{LEAVE} requires special attention: It performs basically the same
service as @code{AHEAD}, but it does not create a control-flow stack
entry. Therefore the information has to be stored elsewhere;
traditionally, the information was stored in the target fields of the
branches created by the @code{LEAVE}s, by organizing these fields into a
linked list. Unfortunately, this clever trick does not provide enough
space for storing our extended control flow information. Therefore, we
introduce another stack, the leave stack. It contains the control-flow
stack entries for all unresolved @code{LEAVE}s.

Local names are kept until the end of the colon definition, even if
they are no longer visible in any control-flow path. In a few cases
this may lead to increased space needs for the locals name area, but
usually less than reclaiming this space would cost in code size.

@item
Locals can only be cell-sized values (no type specifiers are allowed).
@item
Locals can be defined only outside control structures.
@item
Only one locals definition is allowed per colon definition.
@item
Locals can interfere with explicit usage of the return stack. For the
exact (and long) rules, see the standard. If you don't use return stack
accessing words in a definition using locals, you will be all right. The
purpose of this rule is to make locals implementation on the return
stack easier.
@item
The whole locals definition must be in one line.
@end itemize

The Standard Forth locals wordset itself consists of two words:
@code{@{:} and:

doc-(local)

The Forth-2012 locals extension wordset also defines a syntax using
@code{locals|}, but it is so awful that we strongly recommend not to
use it and another, better syntax (the one using @word{{:} was
standardized). We have implemented this syntax to make porting to
Gforth easy, but do not document it here. The problem with this syntax
is that the locals are defined in an order reversed with respect to
the standard stack comment notation, making programs harder to read,
and easier to misread and miswrite.

Gforth comes with three packages for object-oriented programming:
@file{objects.fs}, @file{oof.fs}, and @file{mini-oof.fs}; none of them
is preloaded, so you have to @code{include} them before use. The most
important differences between these packages (and others) are discussed
in @ref{Comparison with other object models}. All packages are written
in Standard Forth and can be used with any other Standard Forth.

@cindex object-oriented programming motivation
@cindex motivation for object-oriented programming

Often we have to deal with several data structures (@emph{objects}),
that have to be treated similarly in some respects, but differently in
others. Graphical objects are the textbook example: circles, triangles,
dinosaurs, icons, and others, and we may want to add more during program
development. We want to apply some operations to any graphical object,
e.g., @code{draw} for displaying it on the screen. However, @code{draw}
has to do something different for every kind of object.
@comment TODO add some other operations eg perimeter, area
@comment and tie in to concrete examples later..

We could implement @code{draw} as a big @code{CASE}
control structure that executes the appropriate code depending on the
kind of object to be drawn. This would be not be very elegant, and,
moreover, we would have to change @code{draw} every time we add
a new kind of graphical object (say, a spaceship).

What we would rather do is: When defining spaceships, we would tell
the system: ``Here's how you @code{draw} a spaceship; you figure
out the rest''.

This is the problem that all systems solve that (rightfully) call
themselves object-oriented; the object-oriented packages presented here
solve this problem (and not much else).

@subsection Object-Oriented Terminology
@cindex object-oriented terminology
@cindex terminology for object-oriented programming

This section is mainly for reference, so you don't have to understand
all of it right away.  The terminology is mainly Smalltalk-inspired.  In
short:

@table @emph
@cindex class
@item class
a data structure definition with some extras.

@cindex object
@item object
an instance of the data structure described by the class definition.

@cindex instance variables
@item instance variables
fields of the data structure.

@cindex selector
@cindex method selector
@cindex virtual function
@item selector
(or @emph{method selector}) a word (e.g.,
@code{draw}) that performs an operation on a variety of data
structures (classes). A selector describes @emph{what} operation to
perform. In C++ terminology: a (pure) virtual function.

@cindex method
@item method
the concrete definition that performs the operation
described by the selector for a specific class. A method specifies
@emph{how} the operation is performed for a specific class.

@cindex selector invocation
@cindex message send
@cindex invoking a selector
@item selector invocation
a call of a selector. One argument of the call (the TOS (top-of-stack))
is used for determining which method is used. In Smalltalk terminology:
a message (consisting of the selector and the other arguments) is sent
to the object.

@cindex receiving object
@item receiving object
the object used for determining the method executed by a selector
invocation. In the @file{objects.fs} model, it is the object that is on
the TOS when the selector is invoked. (@emph{Receiving} comes from
the Smalltalk @emph{message} terminology.)

@cindex child class
@cindex parent class
@cindex inheritance
@item child class
a class that has (@emph{inherits}) all properties (instance variables,
selectors, methods) from a @emph{parent class}. In Smalltalk
terminology: The subclass inherits from the superclass. In C++
terminology: The derived class inherits from the base class.

@end table

@c If you wonder about the message sending terminology, it comes from
@c a time when each object had it's own task and objects communicated via
@c message passing; eventually the Smalltalk developers realized that
@c they can do most things through simple (indirect) calls. They kept the
@c terminology.

@node Properties of the Objects model, Basic Objects Usage, Objects, Objects
@subsubsection Properties of the @file{objects.fs} model
@cindex @file{objects.fs} properties

@itemize @bullet
@item
It is straightforward to pass objects on the stack. Passing
selectors on the stack is a little less convenient, but possible.

@item
Objects are just data structures in memory, and are referenced by their
address. You can create words for objects with normal defining words
like @code{constant}. Likewise, there is no difference between instance
variables that contain objects and those that contain other data.

@item
Late binding is efficient and easy to use.

@item
It avoids parsing, and thus avoids problems with state-smartness
and reduced extensibility; for convenience there are a few parsing
words, but they have non-parsing counterparts. There are also a few
defining words that parse. This is hard to avoid, because all standard
defining words parse (except @code{:noname}); however, such
words are not as bad as many other parsing words, because they are not
state-smart.

@item
It does not try to incorporate everything. It does a few things and does
them well (IMO). In particular, this model was not designed to support
information hiding (although it has features that may help); you can use
a separate package for achieving this.

@item
It is layered; you don't have to learn and use all features to use this
model. Only a few features are necessary (@pxref{Basic Objects Usage},
@pxref{The Objects base class}, @pxref{Creating objects}.), the others
are optional and independent of each other.

@item
An implementation in Standard Forth is available.

@end itemize


@node Basic Objects Usage, The Objects base class, Properties of the Objects model, Objects
@subsubsection Basic @file{objects.fs} Usage
@cindex basic objects usage
@cindex objects, basic usage

You can define a class for graphical objects like this:

@cindex @code{class} usage
@cindex @code{end-class} usage
@cindex @code{selector} usage
@example
object class \ "object" is the parent class
  selector draw ( x y graphical -- )
end-class graphical
@end example

This code defines a class @code{graphical} with an
operation @code{draw}.  We can perform the operation
@code{draw} on any @code{graphical} object, e.g.:

@example
100 100 t-rex draw
@end example

@noindent
where @code{t-rex} is a word (say, a constant) that produces a
graphical object.

@comment TODO add a 2nd operation eg perimeter.. and use for
@comment a concrete example

@cindex abstract class
How do we create a graphical object? With the present definitions,
we cannot create a useful graphical object. The class
@code{graphical} describes graphical objects in general, but not
any concrete graphical object type (C++ users would call it an
@emph{abstract class}); e.g., there is no method for the selector
@code{draw} in the class @code{graphical}.

For concrete graphical objects, we define child classes of the
class @code{graphical}, e.g.:

@cindex @code{overrides} usage
@cindex @code{field} usage in class definition
@example
graphical class \ "graphical" is the parent class
  cell% field circle-radius

:noname ( x y circle -- )
  circle-radius @@ draw-circle ;
overrides draw

:noname ( n-radius circle -- )
  circle-radius ! ;
overrides construct

end-class circle
@end example

Here we define a class @code{circle} as a child of @code{graphical},
with field @code{circle-radius} (which behaves just like a field
(@pxref{Structures}); it defines (using @code{overrides}) new methods
for the selectors @code{draw} and @code{construct} (@code{construct} is
defined in @code{object}, the parent class of @code{graphical}).

Now we can create a circle on the heap (i.e.,
@code{allocate}d memory) with:

@cindex @code{heap-new} usage
@example
50 circle heap-new constant my-circle
@end example

@noindent
@code{heap-new} invokes @code{construct}, thus
initializing the field @code{circle-radius} with 50. We can draw
this new circle at (100,100) with:

@example
100 100 my-circle draw
@end example

@cindex selector invocation, restrictions
@cindex class definition, restrictions
Note: You can only invoke a selector if the object on the TOS
(the receiving object) belongs to the class where the selector was
defined or one of its descendents; e.g., you can invoke
@code{draw} only for objects belonging to @code{graphical}
or its descendents (e.g., @code{circle}).  Immediately before
@code{end-class}, the search order has to be the same as
immediately after @code{class}.

@node The Objects base class, Creating objects, Basic Objects Usage, Objects
@subsubsection The @file{object.fs} base class
@cindex @code{object} class

When you define a class, you have to specify a parent class.  So how do
you start defining classes? There is one class available from the start:
@code{object}. It is ancestor for all classes and so is the
only class that has no parent. It has two selectors: @code{construct}
and @code{print}.

@node Creating objects, Object-Oriented Programming Style, The Objects base class, Objects
@subsubsection Creating objects
@cindex creating objects
@cindex object creation
@cindex object allocation options

@cindex @code{heap-new} discussion
@cindex @code{dict-new} discussion
@cindex @code{construct} discussion
You can create and initialize an object of a class on the heap with
@code{heap-new} ( ... class -- object ) and in the dictionary
(allocation with @code{allot}) with @code{dict-new} (
... class -- object ). Both words invoke @code{construct}, which
consumes the stack items indicated by "..." above.

@cindex @code{init-object} discussion
@cindex @code{class-inst-size} discussion
If you want to allocate memory for an object yourself, you can get its
alignment and size with @code{class-inst-size 2@@} ( class --
align size ). Once you have memory for an object, you can initialize
it with @code{init-object} ( ... class object -- );
@code{construct} does only a part of the necessary work.

@node Object-Oriented Programming Style, Class Binding, Creating objects, Objects
@subsubsection Object-Oriented Programming Style
@cindex object-oriented programming style
@cindex programming style, object-oriented

This section is not exhaustive.

@cindex stack effects of selectors
@cindex selectors and stack effects
In general, it is a good idea to ensure that all methods for the
same selector have the same stack effect: when you invoke a selector,
you often have no idea which method will be invoked, so, unless all
methods have the same stack effect, you will not know the stack effect
of the selector invocation.

One exception to this rule is methods for the selector
@code{construct}. We know which method is invoked, because we
specify the class to be constructed at the same place. Actually, I
defined @code{construct} as a selector only to give the users a
convenient way to specify initialization. The way it is used, a
mechanism different from selector invocation would be more natural
(but probably would take more code and more space to explain).

@node Class Binding, Method conveniences, Object-Oriented Programming Style, Objects
@subsubsection Class Binding
@cindex class binding
@cindex early binding

@cindex late binding
Normal selector invocations determine the method at run-time depending
on the class of the receiving object. This run-time selection is called
@i{late binding}.

Sometimes it's preferable to invoke a different method. For example,
you might want to use the simple method for @code{print}ing
@code{object}s instead of the possibly long-winded @code{print} method
of the receiver class. You can achieve this by replacing the invocation
of @code{print} with:

@cindex @code{[bind]} usage
@example
[bind] object print
@end example

@noindent
in compiled code or:

@cindex @code{bind} usage
@example
bind object print
@end example

@cindex class binding, alternative to
@noindent
in interpreted code. Alternatively, you can define the method with a
name (e.g., @code{print-object}), and then invoke it through the
name. Class binding is just a (often more convenient) way to achieve
the same effect; it avoids name clutter and allows you to invoke
methods directly without naming them first.

@cindex superclass binding
@cindex parent class binding
A frequent use of class binding is this: When we define a method
for a selector, we often want the method to do what the selector does
in the parent class, and a little more. There is a special word for
this purpose: @code{[parent]}; @code{[parent]
@emph{selector}} is equivalent to @code{[bind] @emph{parent
selector}}, where @code{@emph{parent}} is the parent
class of the current class. E.g., a method definition might look like:

@cindex @code{[parent]} usage
@example
:noname
  dup [parent] foo \ do parent's foo on the receiving object
  ... \ do some more
; overrides foo
@end example

@cindex class binding as optimization
In @cite{Object-oriented programming in ANS Forth} (Forth Dimensions,
March 1997), Andrew McKewan presents class binding as an optimization
technique. I recommend not using it for this purpose unless you are in
an emergency. Late binding is pretty fast with this model anyway, so the
benefit of using class binding is small; the cost of using class binding
where it is not appropriate is reduced maintainability.

While we are at programming style questions: You should bind
selectors only to ancestor classes of the receiving object. E.g., say,
you know that the receiving object is of class @code{foo} or its
descendents; then you should bind only to @code{foo} and its
ancestors.

@node Method conveniences, Classes and Scoping, Class Binding, Objects
@subsubsection Method conveniences
@cindex method conveniences

In a method you usually access the receiving object pretty often.  If
you define the method as a plain colon definition (e.g., with
@code{:noname}), you may have to do a lot of stack
gymnastics. To avoid this, you can define the method with @code{m:
... ;m}. E.g., you could define the method for
@code{draw}ing a @code{circle} with

@cindex @code{this} usage
@cindex @code{m:} usage
@cindex @code{;m} usage
@example
m: ( x y circle -- )
  ( x y ) this circle-radius @@ draw-circle ;m
@end example

@cindex @code{exit} in @code{m: ... ;m}
@cindex @code{exitm} discussion
@cindex @code{catch} in @code{m: ... ;m}
When this method is executed, the receiver object is removed from the
stack; you can access it with @code{this} (admittedly, in this
example the use of @code{m: ... ;m} offers no advantage). Note
that I specify the stack effect for the whole method (i.e. including
the receiver object), not just for the code between @code{m:}
and @code{;m}. You cannot use @code{exit} in
@code{m:...;m}; instead, use
@code{exitm}.@footnote{Moreover, for any word that calls
@code{catch} and was defined before loading
@code{objects.fs}, you have to redefine it like I redefined
@code{catch}: @code{: catch this >r catch r> to-this ;}}

@cindex @code{inst-var} usage
You will frequently use sequences of the form @code{this
@emph{field}} (in the example above: @code{this
circle-radius}). If you use the field only in this way, you can
define it with @code{inst-var} and eliminate the
@code{this} before the field name. E.g., the @code{circle}
class above could also be defined with:

@example
graphical class
  cell% inst-var radius

m: ( x y circle -- )
  radius @@ draw-circle ;m
overrides draw

m: ( n-radius circle -- )
  radius ! ;m
overrides construct

end-class circle
@end example

@code{radius} can only be used in @code{circle} and its
descendent classes and inside @code{m:...;m}.

@cindex @code{inst-value} usage
You can also define fields with @code{inst-value}, which is
to @code{inst-var} what @code{value} is to
@code{variable}.  You can change the value of such a field with
@code{[to-inst]}.  E.g., we could also define the class
@code{circle} like this:

@example
graphical class
  inst-value radius

m: ( x y circle -- )
  radius draw-circle ;m
overrides draw

m: ( n-radius circle -- )
  [to-inst] radius ;m
overrides construct

end-class circle
@end example

@c !! :m is easy to confuse with m:.  Another name would be better.

@c Finally, you can define named methods with @code{:m}.  One use of this
@c feature is the definition of words that occur only in one class and are
@c not intended to be overridden, but which still need method context
@c (e.g., for accessing @code{inst-var}s).  Another use is for methods that
@c would be bound frequently, if defined anonymously.


@node Classes and Scoping, Dividing classes, Method conveniences, Objects
@subsubsection Classes and Scoping
@cindex classes and scoping
@cindex scoping and classes

Inheritance is frequent, unlike structure extension. This exacerbates
the problem with the field name convention (@pxref{Standard
Structures}): One always has to remember in which class the field was
originally defined; changing a part of the class structure would
require changes for renaming in otherwise unaffected code.

@cindex @code{inst-var} visibility
@cindex @code{inst-value} visibility
To solve this problem, I added a scoping mechanism (which was not in my
original charter): A field defined with @code{inst-var} (or
@code{inst-value}) is visible only in the class where it is defined and in
the descendent classes of this class.  Using such fields only makes
sense in @code{m:}-defined methods in these classes anyway.

This scoping mechanism allows us to use the unadorned field name,
because name clashes with unrelated words become much less likely.

@cindex @code{protected} discussion
@cindex @code{private} discussion
Once we have this mechanism, we can also use it for controlling the
visibility of other words: All words defined after
@code{protected} are visible only in the current class and its
descendents. @code{public} restores the compilation
(i.e. @code{current}) word list that was in effect before. If you
have several @code{protected}s without an intervening
@code{public} or @code{set-current}, @code{public}
will restore the compilation word list in effect before the first of
these @code{protected}s.

@node Dividing classes, Object Interfaces, Classes and Scoping, Objects
@subsubsection Dividing classes
@cindex Dividing classes
@cindex @code{methods}...@code{end-methods}

You may want to do the definition of methods separate from the
definition of the class, its selectors, fields, and instance variables,
i.e., separate the implementation from the definition.  You can do this
in the following way:

@example
graphical class
  inst-value radius
end-class circle

... \ do some other stuff

circle methods \ now we are ready

m: ( x y circle -- )
  radius draw-circle ;m
overrides draw

m: ( n-radius circle -- )
  [to-inst] radius ;m
overrides construct

end-methods
@end example

You can use several @code{methods}...@code{end-methods} sections.  The
only things you can do to the class in these sections are: defining
methods, and overriding the class's selectors.  You must not define new
selectors or fields.

Note that you often have to override a selector before using it.  In
particular, you usually have to override @code{construct} with a new
method before you can invoke @code{heap-new} and friends.  E.g., you
must not create a circle before the @code{overrides construct} sequence
in the example above.

@node Object Interfaces, Objects Implementation, Dividing classes, Objects
@subsubsection Object Interfaces
@cindex object interfaces
@cindex interfaces for objects

In this model you can only call selectors defined in the class of the
receiving objects or in one of its ancestors. If you call a selector
with a receiving object that is not in one of these classes, the
result is undefined; if you are lucky, the program crashes
immediately.

@cindex selectors common to hardly-related classes
Now consider the case when you want to have a selector (or several)
available in two classes: You would have to add the selector to a
common ancestor class, in the worst case to @code{object}. You
may not want to do this, e.g., because someone else is responsible for
this ancestor class.

The solution for this problem is interfaces. An interface is a
collection of selectors. If a class implements an interface, the
selectors become available to the class and its descendents. A class
can implement an unlimited number of interfaces. For the problem
discussed above, we would define an interface for the selector(s), and
both classes would implement the interface.

As an example, consider an interface @code{storage} for
writing objects to disk and getting them back, and a class
@code{foo} that implements it. The code would look like this:

@cindex @code{interface} usage
@cindex @code{end-interface} usage
@cindex @code{implementation} usage
@example
interface
  selector write ( file object -- )
  selector read1 ( file object -- )
end-interface storage

bar class
  storage implementation

... overrides write
... overrides read1
...
end-class foo
@end example

@noindent
(I would add a word @code{read} @i{( file -- object )} that uses
@code{read1} internally, but that's beyond the point illustrated
here.)

Note that you cannot use @code{protected} in an interface; and
of course you cannot define fields.

In the Neon model, all selectors are available for all classes;
therefore it does not need interfaces. The price you pay in this model
is slower late binding, and therefore, added complexity to avoid late
binding.

@node Objects Implementation, Objects Glossary, Object Interfaces, Objects
@subsubsection @file{objects.fs} Implementation
@cindex @file{objects.fs} implementation

@cindex @code{object-map} discussion
An object is a piece of memory, like one of the data structures
described with @code{struct...end-struct}. It has a field
@code{object-map} that points to the method map for the object's
class.

@cindex method map
@cindex virtual function table
The @emph{method map}@footnote{This is Self terminology; in C++
terminology: virtual function table.} is an array that contains the
execution tokens (@i{xt}s) of the methods for the object's class. Each
selector contains an offset into a method map.

@cindex @code{selector} implementation, class
@code{selector} is a defining word that uses
@code{CREATE} and @code{DOES>}. The body of the
selector contains the offset; the @code{DOES>} action for a
class selector is, basically:

@example
( object addr ) @@ over object-map @@ + @@ execute
@end example

Since @code{object-map} is the first field of the object, it
does not generate any code. As you can see, calling a selector has a
small, constant cost.

@cindex @code{current-interface} discussion
@cindex class implementation and representation
A class is basically a @code{struct} combined with a method
map. During the class definition the alignment and size of the class
are passed on the stack, just as with @code{struct}s, so
@code{field} can also be used for defining class
fields. However, passing more items on the stack would be
inconvenient, so @code{class} builds a data structure in memory,
which is accessed through the variable
@code{current-interface}. After its definition is complete, the
class is represented on the stack by a pointer (e.g., as parameter for
a child class definition).

A new class starts off with the alignment and size of its parent,
and a copy of the parent's method map. Defining new fields extends the
size and alignment; likewise, defining new selectors extends the
method map. @code{overrides} just stores a new @i{xt} in the method
map at the offset given by the selector.

@cindex class binding, implementation
Class binding just gets the @i{xt} at the offset given by the selector
from the class's method map and @code{compile,}s (in the case of
@code{[bind]}) it.

@cindex @code{this} implementation
@cindex @code{catch} and @code{this}
@cindex @code{this} and @code{catch}
I implemented @code{this} as a @code{value}. At the
start of an @code{m:...;m} method the old @code{this} is
stored to the return stack and restored at the end; and the object on
the TOS is stored @code{TO this}. This technique has one
disadvantage: If the user does not leave the method via
@code{;m}, but via @code{throw} or @code{exit},
@code{this} is not restored (and @code{exit} may
crash). To deal with the @code{throw} problem, I have redefined
@code{catch} to save and restore @code{this}; the same
should be done with any word that can catch an exception. As for
@code{exit}, I simply forbid it (as a replacement, there is
@code{exitm}).

@cindex @code{inst-var} implementation
@code{inst-var} is just the same as @code{field}, with
a different @code{DOES>} action:
@example
@@ this +
@end example
Similar for @code{inst-value}.

@cindex class scoping implementation
Each class also has a word list that contains the words defined with
@code{inst-var} and @code{inst-value}, and its protected
words. It also has a pointer to its parent. @code{class} pushes
the word lists of the class and all its ancestors onto the search order stack,
and @code{end-class} drops them.

@cindex interface implementation
An interface is like a class without fields, parent and protected
words; i.e., it just has a method map. If a class implements an
interface, its method map contains a pointer to the method map of the
interface. The positive offsets in the map are reserved for class
methods, therefore interface map pointers have negative
offsets. Interfaces have offsets that are unique throughout the
system, unlike class selectors, whose offsets are only unique for the
classes where the selector is available (invocable).

This structure means that interface selectors have to perform one
indirection more than class selectors to find their method. Their body
contains the interface map pointer offset in the class method map, and
the method offset in the interface method map. The
@code{does>} action for an interface selector is, basically:

@example
( object selector-body )
2dup selector-interface @@ ( object selector-body object interface-offset )
swap object-map @@ + @@ ( object selector-body map )
swap selector-offset @@ + @@ execute
@end example

where @code{object-map} and @code{selector-offset} are
first fields and generate no code.

As a concrete example, consider the following code:

@example
interface
  selector if1sel1
  selector if1sel2
end-interface if1

object class
  if1 implementation

This section describes the @file{oof.fs} package.

The package described in this section has been used in bigFORTH since 1991, and
used for two large applications: a chromatographic system used to
create new medicaments, and a graphic user interface library (MINOS).

You can find a description (in German) of @file{oof.fs} in @cite{Object

@subsubsection Properties of the @file{oof.fs} model
@cindex @file{oof.fs} properties

@itemize @bullet
@item
This model combines object oriented programming with information
hiding. It helps you writing large application, where scoping is
necessary, because it provides class-oriented scoping.

@item
Named objects, object pointers, and object arrays can be created,
selector invocation uses the ``object selector'' syntax. Selector invocation
to objects and/or selectors on the stack is a bit less convenient, but
possible.

@item
Selector invocation and instance variable usage of the active object is
straightforward, since both make use of the active object.

@item
Late binding is efficient and easy to use.

@item
State-smart objects parse selectors. However, extensibility is provided
using a (parsing) selector @code{postpone} and a selector @code{'}.

@item
An implementation in Standard Forth is available.

@subsubsection Basic @file{oof.fs} Usage
@cindex @file{oof.fs} usage

This section uses the same example as for @code{objects} (@pxref{Basic Objects Usage}).

You can define a class for graphical objects like this:

@cindex @code{class} usage
@cindex @code{class;} usage
@cindex @code{method} usage
@example
object class graphical \ "object" is the parent class
  method draw ( x y -- )
class;
@end example

This code defines a class @code{graphical} with an
operation @code{draw}.  We can perform the operation
@code{draw} on any @code{graphical} object, e.g.:

@example
100 100 t-rex draw
@end example

@noindent
where @code{t-rex} is an object or object pointer, created with e.g.
@code{graphical : t-rex}.

@cindex abstract class
How do we create a graphical object? With the present definitions,
we cannot create a useful graphical object. The class
@code{graphical} describes graphical objects in general, but not
any concrete graphical object type (C++ users would call it an
@emph{abstract class}); e.g., there is no method for the selector
@code{draw} in the class @code{graphical}.

For concrete graphical objects, we define child classes of the
class @code{graphical}, e.g.:

@example
graphical class circle \ "graphical" is the parent class
  cell var circle-radius
how:
  : draw ( x y -- )
    circle-radius @@ draw-circle ;

  : init ( n-radius -- )
    circle-radius ! ;
class;
@end example

Here we define a class @code{circle} as a child of @code{graphical},
with a field @code{circle-radius}; it defines new methods for the
selectors @code{draw} and @code{init} (@code{init} is defined in
@code{object}, the parent class of @code{graphical}).

Now we can create a circle in the dictionary with:

@example
50 circle : my-circle
@end example

@noindent
@code{:} invokes @code{init}, thus initializing the field
@code{circle-radius} with 50. We can draw this new circle at (100,100)
with:

@example
100 100 my-circle draw
@end example

@cindex selector invocation, restrictions
@cindex class definition, restrictions
Note: You can only invoke a selector if the receiving object belongs to
the class where the selector was defined or one of its descendents;
e.g., you can invoke @code{draw} only for objects belonging to
@code{graphical} or its descendents (e.g., @code{circle}). The scoping
mechanism will check if you try to invoke a selector that is not
defined in this class hierarchy, so you'll get an error at compilation
time.


@node The OOF base class, Class Declaration, Basic OOF Usage, OOF
@subsubsection The @file{oof.fs} base class
@cindex @file{oof.fs} base class

When you define a class, you have to specify a parent class.  So how do
you start defining classes? There is one class available from the start:
@code{object}. You have to use it as ancestor for all classes. It is the
only class that has no parent. Classes are also objects, except that
they don't have instance variables; class manipulation such as
inheritance or changing definitions of a class is handled through
selectors of the class @code{object}.

@code{object} provides a number of selectors:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{class} for subclassing, @code{definitions} to add definitions
later on, and @code{class?} to get type informations (is the class a
subclass of the class passed on the stack?).

doc---oof-object-class
doc---oof-object-definitions
doc---oof-object-class?


@item
@code{init} and @code{dispose} as constructor and destructor of the
object. @code{init} is invocated after the object's memory is allocated,
while @code{dispose} also handles deallocation. Thus if you redefine
@code{dispose}, you have to call the parent's dispose with @code{super
dispose}, too.

doc---oof-object-init
doc---oof-object-dispose


@item
@code{new}, @code{new[]}, @code{:}, @code{ptr}, @code{asptr}, and
@code{[]} to create named and unnamed objects and object arrays or
object pointers.

doc---oof-object-new
doc---oof-object-new[]
doc---oof-object-:
doc---oof-object-ptr
doc---oof-object-asptr
doc---oof-object-[]


@item
@code{::} and @code{super} for explicit scoping. You should use explicit
scoping only for super classes or classes with the same set of instance
variables. Explicitly-scoped selectors use early binding.

doc---oof-object-::
doc---oof-object-super


@item
@code{self} to get the address of the object

doc---oof-object-self


@item
@code{bind}, @code{bound}, @code{link}, and @code{is} to assign object
pointers and instance defers.

doc---oof-object-bind
doc---oof-object-bound
doc---oof-object-link
doc---oof-object-is


@item
@code{'} to obtain selector tokens, @code{send} to invocate selectors
form the stack, and @code{postpone} to generate selector invocation code.

doc---oof-object-'
doc---oof-object-postpone


@item
@code{with} and @code{endwith} to select the active object from the
stack, and enable its scope. Using @code{with} and @code{endwith}
also allows you to create code using selector @code{postpone} without being
trapped by the state-smart objects.

@cindex mini-oof

Gforth's third object oriented Forth package is a 12-liner. It uses a
mixture of the @file{objects.fs} and the @file{oof.fs} syntax,
and reduces to the bare minimum of features. This is based on a posting
of Bernd Paysan in comp.lang.forth.

@subsubsection Mini-OOF Example
@cindex mini-oof example

A short example shows how to use this package. This example, in slightly
extended form, is supplied as @file{moof-exm.fs}
@comment TODO could flesh this out with some comments from the Forthwrite article

@example
object class
  method init
  method draw
end-class graphical
@end example

This code defines a class @code{graphical} with an
operation @code{draw}.  We can perform the operation
@code{draw} on any @code{graphical} object, e.g.:

@example
100 100 t-rex draw
@end example

where @code{t-rex} is an object or object pointer, created with e.g.
@code{graphical new Constant t-rex}.

For concrete graphical objects, we define child classes of the
class @code{graphical}, e.g.:

@example
graphical class
  cell var circle-radius
end-class circle \ "graphical" is the parent class

:noname ( x y -- )
  circle-radius @@ draw-circle ; circle defines draw
:noname ( r -- )
  circle-radius ! ; circle defines init
@end example

There is no implicit init method, so we have to define one. The creation
code of the object now has to call init explicitly.

@example
circle new Constant my-circle
50 my-circle init
@end example

It is also possible to add a function to create named objects with
automatic call of @code{init}, given that all objects have @code{init}
on the same place:

@example
: new: ( .. o "name" -- )
    new dup Constant init ;
80 circle new: large-circle
@end example

We can draw this new circle at (100,100) with:

@example
100 100 my-circle draw
@end example

@node Mini-OOF Implementation,  , Mini-OOF Example, Mini-OOF
@subsubsection @file{mini-oof.fs} Implementation

Object-oriented systems with late binding typically use a
``vtable''-approach: the first variable in each object is a pointer to a
table, which contains the methods as function pointers. The vtable
may also contain other information.

So first, let's declare selectors:

@example
: method ( m v "name" -- m' v ) Create  over , swap cell+ swap
  DOES> ( ... o -- ... ) @@ over @@ + @@ execute ;
@end example

During selector declaration, the number of selectors and instance
variables is on the stack (in address units). @code{method} creates one
selector and increments the selector number. To execute a selector, it
takes the object, fetches the vtable pointer, adds the offset, and
executes the method @i{xt} stored there. Each selector takes the object
it is invoked with as top of stack parameter; it passes the parameters
(including the object) unchanged to the appropriate method which should
consume that object.

Now, we also have to declare instance variables

@example
: var ( m v size "name" -- m v' ) Create  over , +
  DOES> ( o -- addr ) @@ + ;
@end example

As before, a word is created with the current offset. Instance
variables can have different sizes (cells, floats, doubles, chars), so
all we do is take the size and add it to the offset. If your machine
has alignment restrictions, put the proper @code{aligned} or
@code{faligned} before the variable, to adjust the variable
offset. That's why it is on the top of stack.

We need a starting point (the base object) and some syntactic sugar:

@example
Create object  1 cells , 2 cells ,
: class ( class -- class selectors vars ) dup 2@@ ;
@end example

For inheritance, the vtable of the parent object has to be
copied when a new, derived class is declared. This gives all the
methods of the parent class, which can be overridden, though.

@example
: end-class  ( class selectors vars "name" -- )
  Create  here >r , dup , 2 cells ?DO ['] noop , 1 cells +LOOP
  cell+ dup cell+ r> rot @@ 2 cells /string move ;
@end example

The first line creates the vtable, initialized with
@code{noop}s. The second line is the inheritance mechanism, it
copies the xts from the parent vtable.

We still have no way to define new methods, let's do that now:

@example
: defines ( xt class "name" -- ) ' >body @@ + ! ;
@end example

To allocate a new object, we need a word, too:

@example
: new ( class -- o )  here over @@ allot swap over ! ;
@end example

Sometimes derived classes want to access the method of the
parent object. There are two ways to achieve this with Mini-OOF:
first, you could use named words, and second, you could look up the
vtable of the parent object.

@example
: :: ( class "name" -- ) ' >body @@ + @@ compile, ;
@end example


Nothing can be more confusing than a good example, so here is
one. First let's declare a text object (called
@code{button}), that stores text and position:

@example
object class
  cell var text
  cell var len
  cell var x
  cell var y
  method init
  method draw
end-class button
@end example

@noindent
Now, implement the two methods, @code{draw} and @code{init}:

@example
:noname ( o -- )
 >r r@@ x @@ r@@ y @@ at-xy  r@@ text @@ r> len @@ type ;
 button defines draw
:noname ( addr u o -- )
 >r 0 r@@ x ! 0 r@@ y ! r@@ len ! r> text ! ;
 button defines init
@end example

@noindent
To demonstrate inheritance, we define a class @code{bold-button}, with no
new data and no new selectors:

@example
button class
end-class bold-button

: bold   27 emit ." [1m" ;
: normal 27 emit ." [0m" ;
@end example

@noindent
The class @code{bold-button} has a different draw method to
@code{button}, but the new method is defined in terms of the draw method
for @code{button}:

@example
:noname bold [ button :: draw ] normal ; bold-button defines draw
@end example

@noindent
Finally, create two objects and apply selectors:

@example
button new Constant foo
s" thin foo" foo init
page
foo draw
bold-button new Constant bar
s" fat bar" bar init
1 bar y !
bar draw
@end example

@node Mini-OOF2, Comparison with other object models, Mini-OOF, Object-oriented Forth
@subsection Mini-OOF2

Mini-OOF2 is very similar to Mini-OOF in many respects, but differs
significantly in a few aspects.  In particular, Mini-OOF2 has a current
object variable, and uses the primitives @code{>o} and @code{o>} to
manipulate that object stack.  All method invocations and instance
variable accesses refer to the current object.

doc->o
doc-o>

To ease passing an object pointer to method invocation or instance
variable accesses, the additional recognizer @code{rec-moof2} is
activated.

doc-rec-moof2

To assign methods to selectors, use @var{xt class} @code{is}
@var{selector}, so no @code{defines} necessary.  For early binding of
methods, @code{[} @var{class} @code{] defers} @var{selector} is used, no
need for @code{::}.  Instead of writing @code{:noname} @var{code}
@code{;} @var{class} @code{is} @var{selector}, you can also use the
syntactic sugar @var{class} @code{:method} @var{selector} @var{code} @code{;}.

@subsection Comparison with other object models
@cindex comparison of object models
@cindex object models, comparison

Many object-oriented Forth extensions have been proposed (@cite{A survey
of object-oriented Forths} (SIGPLAN Notices, April 1996) by Bradford
J. Rodriguez and W. F. S. Poehlman lists 17). This section discusses the
relation of the object models described here to two well-known and two
closely-related (by the use of method maps) models.  Andras Zsoter
helped us with this section.

@cindex Neon model
The most popular model currently seems to be the Neon model (see
@cite{Object-oriented programming in ANS Forth} (Forth Dimensions, March
1997) by Andrew McKewan) but this model has a number of limitations
@footnote{A longer version of this critique can be
found in @cite{On Standardizing Object-Oriented Forth Extensions} (Forth
Dimensions, May 1997) by Anton Ertl.}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It uses a @code{@emph{selector object}} syntax, which makes it unnatural
to pass objects on the stack.

@item
It requires that the selector parses the input stream (at
compile time); this leads to reduced extensibility and to bugs that are
hard to find.

@item
It allows using every selector on every object; this eliminates the
need for interfaces, but makes it harder to create efficient
implementations.
@end itemize

@cindex Pountain's object-oriented model
Another well-known publication is @cite{Object-Oriented Forth} (Academic
Press, London, 1987) by Dick Pountain. However, it is not really about
object-oriented programming, because it hardly deals with late
binding. Instead, it focuses on features like information hiding and
overloading that are characteristic of modular languages like Ada (83).

@cindex Zsoter's object-oriented model
In @uref{http://www.forth.org/oopf.html, Does late binding have to be
slow?} (Forth Dimensions 18(1) 1996, pages 31-35) Andras Zsoter
describes a model that makes heavy use of an active object (like
@code{this} in @file{objects.fs}): The active object is not only used
for accessing all fields, but also specifies the receiving object of
every selector invocation; you have to change the active object
explicitly with @code{@{ ... @}}, whereas in @file{objects.fs} it
changes more or less implicitly at @code{m: ... ;m}. Such a change at
the method entry point is unnecessary with Zsoter's model, because the
receiving object is the active object already. On the other hand, the
explicit change is absolutely necessary in that model, because otherwise
no one could ever change the active object. An Standard Forth implementation
of this model is available through
@uref{http://www.forth.org/oopf.html}.

@cindex @file{oof.fs}, differences to other models
The @file{oof.fs} model combines information hiding and overloading
resolution (by keeping names in various word lists) with object-oriented
programming. It sets the active object implicitly on method entry, but
also allows explicit changing (with @code{>o...o>} or with
@code{with...endwith}). It uses parsing and state-smart objects and
classes for resolving overloading and for early binding: the object or
class parses the selector and determines the method from this. If the
selector is not parsed by an object or class, it performs a call to the
selector for the active object (late binding), like Zsoter's model.
Fields are always accessed through the active object. The big
disadvantage of this model is the parsing and the state-smartness, which
reduces extensibility and increases the opportunities for subtle bugs;
essentially, you are only safe if you never tick or @code{postpone} an
object or class (Bernd disagrees, but I (Anton) am not convinced).

@cindex @file{mini-oof.fs}, differences to other models
The @file{mini-oof.fs} model is quite similar to a very stripped-down
version of the @file{objects.fs} model, but syntactically it is a
mixture of the @file{objects.fs} and @file{oof.fs} models.


@c --------------------------------------------------------------
@node Closures, Regular Expressions, Object-oriented Forth, Words
@section Closures
@cindex closures
@cindex flat closures

Gforth provides flat closures (called closures in the following).
Closures are similar to quotations (@pxref{Quotations}), but the
execution token (xt) that represents a closure does not just refer to
code, but also to data.  Running the code of a closure definition
creates a closure data structure (also referred to as ``closure''),
that is represented by an execution token.  The closure data structure
needs to be allocated somewhere, and in Gforth this memory is managed
explicitly.

As an example, consider a word that sums up the results of a function
@code{( n -- r)} across a range of input values:

@source
: sum {: limit start xt -- r :}
  0e limit start ?do
    i xt execute f+
  loop ;
@end source

You can add up the values of the function 1/n for n=1..10 with:

@source
11 1 [: s>f -1e f** ;] sum f.
@end source

Yes, you can do it shorter and more efficiently with @word{1/f}, but
bear with me.  If you want to add up 1/n^2, you can write

@source
11 1 [: s>f -2e f** ;] sum f.
@end source

Now if you want to deal with additional exponents and these exponents
are known at compile time, you can create a new quotation for every
exponent.  But you may prefer to provide an exponent and produce an xt
without having to write down a quotation every time.  If the value of
the exponent is only known at run-time, producing such an xt is
possible in Forth, but even more involved, and consumes dictionary
memory (with limited deallocation options).  Closures come to the
rescue:

@source
: 1/n^r ( r -- xt; xt execution: n -- r1 )
  fnegate [f:h ( n -r ) s>f fswap f** ;] ;

11 1 3e   1/n^r dup >r sum f. r> free-closure
11 1 0.5e 1/n^r dup >r sum f. r> free-closure
@end source

When @word{1/n^r} runs, it creates a closure that incorporates a
floating-point number (indicated by the @code{f} in @word{[f:h}), in
particular the value -r.  It also references the code between
@word{[f:h} and @word{;]}.  The memory for the closure comes from the
heap, i.e. @word{allocate}d memory (indicated by the @code{h} in
@word{[f:h}).  @word{1/n^r} produces an xt representing this closure.
This xt is then passed to @word{sum} and @word{execute}d there.

When the closure is executed (in @word{sum}), -r is pushed (in
addition to the n that has already been pushed before the
@word{execute}) and the code of the closure is run.

The code above shows a pure-stack closure (no locals involved).
Pure-stack closures start with a word with the naming scheme
@code{[@i{T}:@i{A}} where the type @i{T} can be @code{n} (cell),
@code{d} (double-cell), or @code{f} (FP).  The allocator @i{A} can be
@code{l} (local), @code{d} (dictionary), @code{h} (heap), or
@code{h1}: @code{Allocate} the closure on the heap and @code{free} it
after the first execution; this is used for passing data to another
task with @word{send-event} (@pxref{Message queues}).  A pure-stack
closure consumes one @i{T} from a stack at closure creation time (when
the code containing the closure definition is run), and pushes an xt.
After creating the closure, execution continues behind the @word{;]}.

When the xt is executed (directly with @word{execute} or indirectly
through, e.g., @word{compile,} or a deferred word), it pushes the
stack item that was consumed at closure creation time and then runs
the code inside the closure definition (up to the @word{;]}).  You can
deallocate heap-allocated closures with

doc-free-closure

Like a quotation, a (flat) closure cannot access locals of the
enclosing definition(s).

The words for starting pure-stack closure definitions are:

doc-[n:l
doc-[d:l
doc-[f:l
doc-[n:d
doc-[d:d
doc-[f:d
doc-[n:h
doc-[d:h
doc-[f:h
doc-[n:h1
doc-[d:h1
doc-[f:h1

If you want to pass more than one stack item from closure creation to
execution time, defining more such words becomes unwieldy, and the
code inside the closure definition might have to juggle many stack
items, so Gforth does not provide such additional words.  Instead,
Gforth offers flat closures that define locals.  Here's the example
above, but using locals-defining closures:

@source
: 1/n^r ( r -- xt; xt execution: n -- r1 )
  fnegate [{: f: -r :}h s>f -r f** ;] ;
@end source
  
The number, types, and order of the locals are used for specifying how
many and which stack items are consumed at closure creation time.  At
closure execution time these values become the values of the locals.
The locals definition ends with a word with a naming scheme
@code{:@}@i{A}}, where @i{A} specifies where the closure is allocated:
@code{l} (local), @code{d} (dictionary), @code{h} (heap), or @code{h1}
(heap, @code{free} on first execution).

Note that the locals are still strictly local to one execution of the
xt, and any changes to the locals (e.g., with @word{to}) do not change
the values stored in the closure; i.e., in the next execution of the
closure the locals will be initialized with the values that closure
creation consumed.

doc-[{:
doc-:}l
doc-:}d
doc-:}h
doc-:}h1
doc-:}xt
doc->addr

If you look at closures in other languages (e.g., Scheme), they are
quite different: data is passed by accessing and possibly changing
locals of enclosing definitions (lexical scoping).  Gforth's closures
are based on the flat closures used in the implementation of Scheme,
so by writing the code appropriately (see the following subsections)
you can do the same things with Gforth's closures as with
lexical-scoping closures.

In our programming we have not missed lexical scoping, except when
trying to convert code (usually textbook examples) coming from another
language.  I.e., in our experience flat closures are as useful and
similarly convenient as lexical scoping.  For comparison, if Gforth
supported lexical scoping instead of flat closures, the definition of
@word{1/n^r} might look as follows:

@source
\ this does not work in Gforth:
: 1/n^r ( r -- xt; xt execution: n -- r1 )
  fnegate {: -r :} [:h s>f -r f** ;] ;
@end source

But if you want to know how to convert lexical scoping to Gforth's
flat closures, the following subsections explain it.

@node  How do I read outer locals?, How do I write outer locals?, Closures, Closures
@subsection How do I read outer locals?
@cindex closure conversion

As long as you only read the value of locals, you can duplicate them
as needed, so a way to convert an access to an outer local for flat
closures is to just pass the values on the stack to the closures and
define them again as locals there.  Here's an example: Consider the
following code for a hypothetical Gforth with a quotation-like syntax
for lexical-scoping closures:


@source
\ does not work; [:d would dictionary-allocate the closure
: ...
  ... {: a b :} ...
  [:d ...
    ... {: c d :} ...
    [:d ... a b c d ... ;]
    ...
  ;]
  ... ;
@end source

you can convert it to flat closures as follows:

@source
: ...
  ... {: a b :} ...
  a b [{: a b :}d ...
    ... {: c d :} ...
    a b c d [{: a b c d :}d
      ... a b c d ... ;]
    ...
  ;]
  ... ;
@end source

Only those locals that are read in the closure need to be passed in.

This process is called @emph{closure conversion} in the programming
language implementation literature.


@node How do I write outer locals?,  , How do I read outer locals?, Closures
@subsection How do I write outer locals?
@cindex assignment conversion

A local instance that is written and read must exist at only one
location, its home location.  The address of this home location is
only read and can be duplicated and passed around.  A textbook example
might look like this in a hypothetical Gforth with lexical-scoping and
explicit dictionary allocation:

@source
\ does not work
: counter ( -- xt-inc xt-val )
  0 {: n :}d
  [:d n 1+ to n ;]
  [:d n ;]
;
\ for usage example see below
@end source

Instead, you allocate the home location, and pass its address around:

@source
: counter ( -- xt-inc xt-val )
  align here {: np :} 0 , \ home location
  np [{: np :}d 1 np +! ;]
  np [{: np :}d np @ ;]
;
\ usage example
counter \ first instance
dup execute . \ prints 0
over execute
over execute
dup execute . \ prints 2
counter \ second instance
over execute
dup execute . \ prints 1
2swap \ work on first instance again
dup execute . \ prints 2
@end source

This introduction of a home location is called @emph{assignment
conversion} in the programming language implementation literature.

You can also use pure-stack closures in this case:

@source
: counter ( -- xt-inc xt-val )
  align here {: np :} 0 , \ home location
  np [n:d 1 swap +! ;]
  np [n:d @ ;]
;
\ same usage
@end source

Instead of dictionary allocation you can also @word{allocate} on the
heap.  For local allocation of the home location you can use
variable-flavoured locals (@pxref{Gforth locals}), but of course then
the closures must not be used after leaving the definition in which
the home location is defined.  E.g.

@source
: counter-example ( -- )
  0 {: w^ np :} \ home location
  np [n:d 1 swap +! ;]
  np [n:d @ ;]
  dup execute cr . 
  over execute
  over execute
  dup execute cr .
  2drop
;
counter-example \ prints 0 and 2
@end source

There is actually rarely a reason to use home locations at all,
because what the textbook examples do with closures and writable
locals can be done in Gforth more directly with structs
(@pxref{Structures}) or objects (@pxref{Object-oriented Forth}), or in
the counter example, simply with @word{create}:

@source
: counter ( "name" -- )
  create 0 , ;
: counter-inc ( addr -- )
  1 swap +! ;
: counter-val ( addr -- )
  @ ;
\ usage example
counter a
a counter-val . \ prints 0
a counter-inc
a counter-inc
a counter-val . \ prints 2
counter b
b counter-inc
b counter-val . \ prints 1
a counter-val . \ prints 2
@end source

Still, for dictionary and heap allocation Gforth has a home-location
definition syntax based on the locals-definition syntax.  Here's a
heap-allocation version of @word{counter} using closures and the
locals-like home-location syntax:

@source
: counter ( -- handle xt-inc xt-val )
  0 <{: w^ np :}h
  np [n:h 1 swap +! ;]
  np [n:h @ ;]
  ;> -rot ;
\ usage example
counter \ first instance
dup execute . \ prints 0
over execute
over execute
dup execute . \ prints 2
counter \ second instance
over execute
dup execute . \ prints 1
free-closure free-closure free throw \ back to first instance
dup execute . \ prints 2
free-closure free-clouse free throw
@end source

Here @word{<{:} starts a locals scope (similar to a closure itself),
then you define (variable-flavoured) locals.  @word{:}h} (or
@word{:}d}) finishes the locals definition.  Now (and up to @word{;>})
you can use the names of the defined locals.  Finally, @word{;>} ends
the scope and pushes the start address of the allocated home-location
block (also when using @word{:}d} for dictionary allocation), for
@word{free}ing the home-location block later.

We have produced no uses of @word{<{:} and @word{;>} in the first 6
years that they were present in (development) Gforth.  We think that
the reason is that one prefers structs or objects for modifiable data.
Therefore, we intend to remove these words in the future.  If you want
to see them preserved, contact us and make a case for them.

@node Regular Expressions, Programming Tools, Closures, Words
@section Regular Expressions
@cindex regexps

Regular expressions are pattern matching algorithms for strings found in
many contemporary languages.  You can add regular expression
functionality to Gforth with @code{require regexp.fs}.

The classical implementation for this pattern matching is a backtracking
algorithm, which is also necessary if you want to have features like
backreferencing.  Gforth implements regular expressions by providing a
language to define backtracking programs for pattern matching.  Basic
element is the control structure @code{FORK} @dots{} @code{JOIN}, which
is a forward call within a word, and therefore allows to code a
lightweight try and fail control structure.

doc-FORK
doc-JOIN

You can program any sort of arbitrary checks yourself by computing a
flag and @code{?LEAVE} when the check fails.  Your regular expression
code is enclosed in @code{((} and @code{))}.

doc-((
doc-))

Pattern matching in regular expressions have character sets as elements,
so a number of functions allow you to create and modify character sets
(called @code{charclass}).  All characters here are bytes, so this
doesn't extend to unicode characters.

doc-charclass
doc-+char
doc--char
doc-..char
doc-+chars
doc-+class
doc--class

There are predefined charclasses and tests for them, and generic checks.
If a check fails, the next possible alternative of the regular
expression is tried, or a loop is terminated.

doc-c?
doc--c?
doc-\d
doc-\s
doc-.?
doc--\d
doc--\s
doc-`
doc-`?
doc--`

You can certainly also check for start and end of the string, and for
whole string constants.

doc-\^
doc-\$
doc-str=?
doc-="

Loops that check for repeated character sets can be greedy or
non-greedy.

doc-{**
doc-**}
doc-{++
doc-++}
doc-{*
doc-*}
doc-{+
doc-+}

Example: Searching for a substring really is a non-greedy match of
anything in front of it.

doc-//

Alternatives are written with

doc-{{
doc-||
doc-}}

You can use up to 9 variables named @code{\1} to @code{\9} to refer to
matched substrings

doc-\(

doc-\0

Certainly, you can also write code to replace patterns you found.

@cindex status bar
@cindex prompt
@cindex @code{ok} prompt
@cindex @code{compiling} prompt

In interactive usage Gforth shows the status after processing each
line.  The status consists of the ``prompt'' behind the end of the
output of the words on the line and optionally a status bar at the
bottom (on by default if the terminal is a color terminal).

The prompt shows the current text interpreter state (@code{ok}
(interpretation), @code{compiling}, or @code{postponing}) and the
number of items on the data stack (nothing shown if empty) and the FP
stack (nothing shown if empty).  E.g., if there are two items on the
data stack and one item on the FP stack, @code{2 f:1} is shown.

The status bar is in blue for interpretation, magenta for compilation,
and red for postponing state.  By default it shows the contents of
@word{base} in decimal (not shown when the base is decimal), the
number of items on the data stack and the top items of the data stack,
the number of items on the FP stack, and the top items on the FP
stack, the search order and the current wordlist.  What is shown can

Many programming systems are organized as an integrated development
environment (IDE) where the editor is the hub of the system, and
allows building and running programs.  If you want that, Gforth has
it, too (@pxref{Emacs and Gforth}).

However, several Forth systems have a different kind of IDE: The Forth
command line is the hub of the environment; you can view the source
from there in various ways, and call an editor if needed.

Gforth also implements such an IDE.  It mostly follows the conventions
of SwiftForth where they exist, but implements features beyond them.

An advantage of this approach is that it allows you to use your
favourite editor: set the environment variable @code{EDITOR} to your
favourite editor, and the editing commands will call that editor;
Gforth invokes some GUI editors in the background (so you do not need
to finish editing to continue with your Forth session), terminal
editors in the foreground (default for editors not known to Gforth is
foreground).  If you have not set @code{EDITOR}, the default editor is
@file{vi}.
@c !! cursor keys

The @emph{current location} is set by a number of other words in
addition to @code{locate}.  Also, when an error happens while loading
a file, the location of the error becomes the current location.

A number of words work with the current location:

You can control how many lines @code{l}, @code{n} and @code{b} show by
changing the values:

and then using @code{see-code foo} outputs:

@end example

First, you see a threaded-code cell for a static superinstruction with
the components @code{lit} and @code{f@@}, starting and ending with one
data stack item in a register (@code{1->1}); this is followed by the
cell for the argument @code{x} of @code{lit}, and the cell for the
@code{f@@} component of the superinstruction; the latter cell is not
used, but is there for Gforth-internal reasons.

Next, the dynamically generated native code for the superinstruction
@code{lit f@@} is shown; note that this native code is not mixed with
the threaded code in memory, as you can see by comparing the
addresses.

If you want to understand the native code shown here: the
threaded-code instruction pointer is in @code{r13}, the data stack
pointer in @code{r15}; the first data stack register is @code{r8}
(i.e., the top of stack resides there if there is one data stack item
in a register); the return stack pointer is in @code{rbx}, the FP
stack pointer in @code{r12}, and the top of the floating-pont stack in
@code{xmm15}.  Note that the register assignments vary between
engines, so you may see a different register assignment for this code.

The dynamic native code for @code{lit f@@} ends with a dispatch jump
(aka NEXT), because the code for the next word @code{fsin} in the
definition is not dynamically generated.

Next, you see the threaded-code cell for @code{fsin}.  There is no
dynamically-generated native code for this word, and @code{see-code}
does not show the static native code for it (you can look at it with
@code{see fsin}).  Like all words with static native code in
@code{gforth-fast}, the effect on the data stack representation is
@code{1->1} (for @code{gforth}, @code{0->0}), but this is not shown.

Next, you see the threaded-code cell for @code{drop}; the native-code
variant used here starts with one data stack item in registers, and
ends with zero data stack items in registers (@code{1->0}).  This is
followed by the native code for this variant of @code{drop}.  There is
no NEXT here, because the native code falls through to the code for
the next word.

Next, you see the threaded-code cell for @code{over} followed by the
dynamically-generated native code in the @code{0->1} variant.

Finally, you see the threaded and native code for @code{;s} (the
primitive compiled for @code{;} in @code{foo}).  @code{;s} performs
control flow (it returns), so it has to end with a NEXT.

@subsection Forgetting words
@cindex words, forgetting
@cindex forgeting words

@c  anton: other, maybe better places for this subsection: Defining Words;
@c  Dictionary allocation.  At least a reference should be there.

Forth allows you to forget words (and everything that was allotted in the
dictionary after them) in a LIFO manner.

doc-marker

The most common use of this feature is during program development: when
you change a source file, forget all the words it defined and load it
again (since you also forget everything defined after the source file
was loaded, you have to reload that, too).  Note that effects like
storing to variables and destroyed system words are not undone when you
forget words.  With a system like Gforth, that is fast enough at
starting up and compiling, I find it more convenient to exit and restart
Gforth, as this gives me a clean slate.

Here's an example of using @code{marker} at the start of a source file
that you are debugging; it ensures that you only ever have one copy of
the file's definitions compiled at any time:

@example
[IFDEF] my-code
    my-code
[THEN]

marker my-code

\ .. definitions start here

@node Debugging, Assertions, Forgetting words, Programming Tools
@subsection Debugging
@cindex debugging

Languages with a slow edit/compile/link/test development loop tend to
require sophisticated tracing/stepping debuggers to facilate debugging.

A much better (faster) way in fast-compiling languages is to add
printing code at well-selected places, let the program run, look at
the output, see where things went wrong, add more printing code, etc.,
until the bug is found.

The simple debugging aids provided in @file{debugs.fs}
are meant to support this style of debugging.

The word @code{~~} prints debugging information (by default the source
location and the stack contents). It is easy to insert. If you use Emacs
it is also easy to remove (@kbd{C-x ~} in the Emacs Forth mode to
query-replace them with nothing). The deferred words
@code{printdebugdata} and @code{.debugline} control the output of
@code{~~}. The default source location output format works well with
Emacs' compilation mode, so you can step through the program at the
source level using @kbd{C-x `} (the advantage over a stepping debugger
is that you can step in any direction and you know where the crash has
happened or where the strange data has occurred).

@node Assertions, Singlestep Debugger, Debugging, Programming Tools
@subsection Assertions
@cindex assertions

It is a good idea to make your programs self-checking, especially if you
make an assumption that may become invalid during maintenance (for
example, that a certain field of a data structure is never zero). Gforth
supports @dfn{assertions} for this purpose. They are used like this:

@example
assert( @i{flag} )
@end example

The code between @code{assert(} and @code{)} should compute a flag, that
should be true if everything is alright and false otherwise. It should
not change anything else on the stack. The overall stack effect of the
assertion is @code{( -- )}. E.g.

@example
assert( 1 1 + 2 = ) \ what we learn in school
assert( dup 0<> ) \ assert that the top of stack is not zero
assert( false ) \ this code should not be reached
@end example

The need for assertions is different at different times. During
debugging, we want more checking, in production we sometimes care more
for speed. Therefore, assertions can be turned off, i.e., the assertion
becomes a comment. Depending on the importance of an assertion and the
time it takes to check it, you may want to turn off some assertions and
keep others turned on. Gforth provides several levels of assertions for
this purpose:


doc-assert0(
doc-assert1(
doc-assert2(
doc-assert3(
doc-assert(
doc-)


The variable @code{assert-level} specifies the highest assertions that
are turned on. I.e., at the default @code{assert-level} of one,
@code{assert0(} and @code{assert1(} assertions perform checking, while
@code{assert2(} and @code{assert3(} assertions are treated as comments.

The value of @code{assert-level} is evaluated at compile-time, not at
run-time. Therefore you cannot turn assertions on or off at run-time;
you have to set the @code{assert-level} appropriately before compiling a
piece of code. You can compile different pieces of code at different
@code{assert-level}s (e.g., a trusted library at level 1 and
newly-written code at level 3).


doc-assert-level


If an assertion fails, a message compatible with Emacs' compilation mode
is produced and the execution is aborted (currently with @code{ABORT"}.
If there is interest, we will introduce a special throw code. But if you
intend to @code{catch} a specific condition, using @code{throw} is
probably more appropriate than an assertion).

@cindex filenames in assertion output
Assertions (and @code{~~}) will usually print the wrong file name if a
marker is executed in the same file after their occurrence.  They will
print @samp{*somewhere*} as file name if a marker is executed in the
same file before their occurrence.

Definitions in Standard Forth for these assertion words are provided
in @file{compat/assert.fs}.

400D4758  804B384 ;              ->  ok
@end example

Each line displayed is one step. You always have to hit return to
execute the next word that is displayed. If you don't want to execute
the next word in a whole, you have to type @kbd{n} for @code{nest}. Here is
an overview what keys are available:

@table @i

@item @key{RET}
Next; Execute the next word.

@item n
Nest; Single step through next word.

@item u
Unnest; Stop debugging and execute rest of word. If we got to this word
with nest, continue debugging with the calling word.

@item d
Done; Stop debugging and execute rest.

@item s
Stop; Abort immediately.

@end table

Debugging large application with this mechanism is very difficult, because
you have to nest very deeply into the program before the interesting part
begins. This takes a lot of time. 

To do it more directly put a @code{BREAK:} command into your source code.
When program execution reaches @code{BREAK:} the single step debugger is
invoked and you have all the features described above.

If you have more than one part to debug it is useful to know where the
program has stopped at the moment. You can do this by the 
@code{BREAK" string"} command. This behaves like @code{BREAK:} except that
string is typed out when the ``breakpoint'' is reached.

If you run extensive tests on your code, you often want to figure out
if the tests exercise all parts of the code.  This is called (test)
coverage.  The file @file{coverage.fs} contains tools for measuring
the coverage as well as execution frequency.

Code coverage inserts counting code in every basic block
(straight-line code sequence) loaded after @file{coverage.fs}.  Each
time that code is run, it increments the counter for that basic block.
Later you can show the source file with the counts inserted in these
basic blocks.

doc-nocov[
doc-]nocov
doc-coverage?
doc-cov+
doc-?cov+
doc-.coverage
doc-annotate-cov
doc-cov%
doc-.cover-raw

By default, the counts are shown in colour (using ANSI escape
sequences), but you can use @code{bw-cover} to show them in
parenthesized form without escape sequences.

doc-bw-cover
doc-color-cover

You can save and reload the coverage counters in binary format, to
aggregate coverage counters across several test runs of the same
program.

Gforth offers two multitaskers: a traditional, cooperative round-robin
multitasker, and a pthread-based multitasker which allows to run several
threads concurrently on multi-core machines.  The pthread-based is now
marked as experimental feature, as standardization of Forth
multitaskers will likely change the names of words without changing
their semantics.

@subsection Pthreads
@cindex pthread

@c You need to include @file{unix/pthread.fs} to use the following words.

Posix threads can run in parallel on several cores, or with
pre-emptive multitasking on onecore.  However, many of the following
words are the same as in the traditional cooperative multi-tasker.

In addition, there are words that allow you to make sure that only one
task at a time changes something, and for communicating between tasks.
These words are necessary for pre-emptive and multi-core
multi-tasking, because the cooperative-multitasking way of performing
transactions between calls to @code{pause} does not work in this
environment.

@node Basic multi-tasking, Task-local data, Pthreads, Pthreads
@subsubsection Basic multi-tasking

Tasks can be created with @code{newtask} or @code{newtask4} with a
given amount of stack space (either all the same or each stack's size
specified).

doc-newtask
doc-task
doc-newtask4

If you don't know which stack sizes to use for the task, you can use
the size(s) of the main task:

doc-stacksize
doc-stacksize4

A task is created in an inactive state.  To let it run, you have to
activate it with one of the following words:

doc-initiate

The following legacy words provide the same functionality as
@code{initiate}, but with a different interface: Like @code{does>}, they
split their containing colon definition in two parts: The part before
@code{activate}/@code{pass} runs in the activating task, and returns to
its caller after activating the task.  The part behind
@code{activate}/@code{pass} is executed in the activated target task.

doc-activate
doc-pass

You can also do creation and activation in one step:

doc-execute-task

Apart from terminating by running to the end, a task can terminate
itself with @code{kill-task}.  Other tasks can terminate it with
@code{kill}.

doc-kill-task
doc-kill

Tasks can also temporarily stop themselves or be stopped:

doc-halt
doc-sleep
doc-stop
doc-stop-ns
doc-stop-dns
doc-thread-deadline

Using @code{stop-dns} is easier to code, but if you want your task to
wake up at regular intervals rather than some time after it finished
its last piece of work, the way to go is to work with deadlines.

A task restarts when the timeout is over or when another task wakes it
with:

doc-wake
doc-restart

There is also:

doc-pause

@node Task-local data, Semaphores, Basic multi-tasking, Pthreads
@subsubsection Task-local data
@cindex user variables
@cindex user space
@cindex task-local data

In Forth every task has essentially the same task-local data, called
``user'' area (early Forth systems were multi-user systems and there
often was one user per task).  The @i{task} result of,
e.g. @code{newtask} is the start address of its user area.  Each task
gets the user data defined by the system (e.g., @code{base}).  You can
define additional user data with:

doc-user
doc-auser
doc-uallot
doc-uvalue
doc-udefer

There are also the following words for dealing with user data.

doc-up@
doc-user'
doc-'s

@c doc-udp

The pictured numeric output buffer is also task-local, but other areas
like dictionary or @code{PAD} are shared.

@node Semaphores, Hardware operations for multi-tasking, Task-local data, Pthreads
@subsubsection Semaphores

A cooperative multitasker can ensure that there is no other task
interacting between two invocations of @code{pause}.  Pthreads however
are really concurrent tasks (at least on a multi-core CPU), and
therefore, several techniques to avoid conflicts when accessing the same
resources.

Semaphores can only be acquired by one thread, all other threads have to
wait until the semapohre is released.

doc-semaphore
doc-lock
doc-unlock

The other approach to prevent concurrent access is the critical section.
Here, we implement a critical section with a semaphore, so you have to
specify the semaphore which is used for the critical section.  Only
those critical sections which use the same semaphore are mutually
exclusive.

doc-critical-section

@node Hardware operations for multi-tasking, Message queues, Semaphores, Pthreads
@subsubsection Hardware operations for multi-tasking
@cindex atomic operations

Atomic hardware operations perform the whole operation, without any
other task seeing an intermediate state.  These operations can be used
to synchronize tasks without using slow OS primitives, but compared to
the non-atomic sequences of operations they tend to be slow.  Atomic
operations only work correctly on aligned addresses, even on hardware
that otherwise does not require alignment.

doc-atomic!@
@cindex fetch and add
doc-atomic+!@
@cindex compare and swap
doc-atomic?!@

There are also the non-atomic @word{!@} and @word{+!@} (otherwise the
same behaviour, @pxref{Memory Access}).

Another hardware operation is the memory barrier.  Unfortunately
modern hardware often can reorder memory operations relative to other
memory operations (as seen by a different core), and the memory
barrier suppresses this reordering for one point in the execution of
the task.
@cindex memory barrier

doc-barrier

@node Message queues,  , Hardware operations for multi-tasking, Pthreads
@subsubsection Message queues

Gforth's message queues are a variant of the actor model.

The sending task tells the receiving task to execute an xt with the
stack effect @code{( -- )} (an @emph{event} in the name of the words
below; the actor model would call these xts @emph{messages}), and when
the receiving task is ready, it will execute the xt, possibly after
other xts from its message queue.

The execution order between xts from different tasks is arbitrary, the
order between xts from the same task is the sending order.

In many cases you do not just want to pass the xts of existing words,
but also parameters.  You can construct execute-once closures (defined
using @code{:@}h1}, @pxref{Closures}) to achieve that, e.g., with

@example
: .-in-task ( n task -- )
  >r [@{: n :@}h1 n . ;] r> send-event ;

5 my-task .-in-task \ my-task prints 5
@end example

doc-send-event

In order to execute xts received from other tasks, perform one of the
following words in the receiving task:

doc-?events
doc-event-loop

Alternatively, when a task is @code{stop}ped, it is also ready for
receiving xts, and receiving an xt will not just execute the xt, but
also continue execution after the @code{stop}.

@node Cilk,  , Pthreads, Multitasker
@subsection Cilk

Gforth's Cilk is a framework for dividing work between multiple tasks
running on several cores, inspired by the programming language of the
same name.  Use @code{require cilk.fs} if you want to use Cilk.

The idea is that you identify subproblems that can be solved in
parallel, and the framework assigns worker tasks to these subproblems.
In particular, you use one of the @code{spawn} words for each subtask.
Eventually you need to wait with @code{cilk-sync} for the subproblems
to be solved.

Currently all the spawning has to happen from one task, and
@code{cilk-sync} waits for all subproblems to complete, so using the
current Gforth Cilk for recursive algorithms is not straightforward.

Do not divide the subproblems too finely, in order to avoid overhead;
how fine is too fine depends on how uniform the run-time for the
subproblems is, but for problems with substantial run-time, having
5*@code{cores} subproblems is probably a good starting point.

@cindex interface to C functions

Gforth's C interface works by compiling a wrapper library that contains
C functions which take parameters from the Forth stacks and calls the C
functions.  This wrapper library is compiled by the C compiler.
Compilation results are cached, so that Gforth only needs to rerun the C
compilation if the wrapper library has to change.  This build process is
automatic, and done at the end of a interface declaration.  Gforth uses
libtool and GCC for that process.

The C interface is now mostly complete, callbacks have been added, but
for structs, we use Forth2012 structs, which don't have independent
scopes.  The offsets of those structs are extracted from header files
with a SWIG plugin.

@node Calling C Functions, Declaring C Functions, C Interface, C Interface
@subsection Calling C functions
@cindex C functions, calls to
@cindex calling C functions

Once a C function is declared (@pxref{Declaring C Functions}), you
can call it as follows: You push the arguments on the stack(s), and
then call the word for the C function.  The arguments have to be
pushed in the same order as the arguments appear in the C
documentation (i.e., the first argument is deepest on the stack).
Integer and pointer arguments have to be pushed on the data stack,
floating-point arguments on the FP stack; these arguments are consumed
by the called C function.

On returning from the C function, the return value, if any, resides on
the appropriate stack: an integer return value is pushed on the data
stack, an FP return value on the FP stack, and a void return value
results in not pushing anything.  Note that most C functions have a
return value, even if that is often not used in C; in Forth, you have
to @code{drop} this return value explicitly if you do not use it.

The C interface automatically converts between the C type and the
Forth type as necessary, on a best-effort basis (in some cases, there
may be some loss).

As an example, consider the POSIX function @code{lseek()}:

@example
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
@end example

This function takes three integer arguments, and returns an integer
argument, so a Forth call for setting the current file offset to the
start of the file could look like this:

@example
fd @@ 0 SEEK_SET lseek -1 = if
  ... \ error handling
then
@end example

You might be worried that an @code{off_t} does not fit into a cell, so
you could not pass larger offsets to lseek, and might get only a part
of the return values.  In that case, in your declaration of the
function (@pxref{Declaring C Functions}) you should declare it to use
double-cells for the off_t argument and return value, and maybe give
the resulting Forth word a different name, like @code{dlseek}; the
result could be called like this:

@example
fd @@ 0. SEEK_SET dlseek -1. d= if
  ... \ error handling
then
@end example

Passing and returning structs or unions is currently not supported by
our interface@footnote{If you know the calling convention of your C
compiler, you usually can call such functions in some way, but that
way is usually not portable between platforms, and sometimes not even
between C compilers.}.

Calling functions with a variable number of arguments (@emph{variadic}
functions, e.g., @code{printf()}) is only supported by having you
declare one function-calling word for each argument pattern, and
calling the appropriate word for the desired pattern.



@node Declaring C Functions, Calling C function pointers, Calling C Functions, C Interface
@subsection Declaring C Functions
@cindex C functions, declarations
@cindex declaring C functions

Before you can call @code{lseek} or @code{dlseek}, you have to declare
it.  The declaration consists of two parts: 

@table @b

@item The C part
is the C declaration of the function, or more typically and portably,
a C-style @code{#include} of a file that contains the declaration of
the C function.

@item The Forth part
declares the Forth types of the parameters and the Forth word name
corresponding to the C function.

@end table

For the words @code{lseek} and @code{dlseek} mentioned earlier, the
declarations are:

@example
\c #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
\c #include <sys/types.h>
\c #include <unistd.h>
c-function lseek lseek n n n -- n
c-function dlseek lseek n d n -- d
@end example

The C part of the declarations is prefixed by @code{\c}, and the rest
of the line is ordinary C code.  You can use as many lines of C
declarations as you like, and they are visible for all further
function declarations.

The Forth part declares each interface word with @code{c-function},
followed by the Forth name of the word, the C name of the called
function, and the stack effect of the word.  The stack effect contains
an arbitrary number of types of parameters, then @code{--}, and then
exactly one type for the return value.  The possible types are:

@table @code

@item n
single-cell integer

@item a
address (single-cell)

@item d
double-cell integer

@item r
floating-point value

@item func
C function pointer

@item void
no value (used as return type for void functions)

@end table

@cindex variadic C functions

To deal with variadic C functions, you can declare one Forth word for
every pattern you want to use, e.g.:

@example
\c #include <stdio.h>
c-function printf-nr printf a n r -- n
c-function printf-rn printf a r n -- n
@end example

Note that with C functions declared as variadic (or if you don't
provide a prototype), the C interface has no C type to convert to, so
no automatic conversion happens, which may lead to portability
problems in some cases.  You can add the C type cast in curly braces
after the Forth type.  This also allows to pass e.g. structs to C
functions, which in Forth cannot live on the stack.

@example
c-function printfll printf a n@{(long long)@} -- n
c-function pass-struct pass_struct a@{*(struct foo *)@} -- n
@end example

This typecasting is not available to return values, as C does not
allow typecasts for lvalues.

doc-\c
doc-c-function
doc-c-value
doc-c-variable

In order to work, this C interface invokes GCC at run-time and uses
dynamic linking.  If these features are not available, there are
other, less convenient and less portable C interfaces in @file{lib.fs}
and @file{oldlib.fs}.  These interfaces are mostly undocumented and
mostly incompatible with each other and with the documented C
interface; you can find some examples for the @file{lib.fs} interface
in @file{lib.fs}.


@node Calling C function pointers, Defining library interfaces, Declaring C Functions, C Interface
@subsection Calling C function pointers from Forth
@cindex C function pointers, calling from Forth

If you come across a C function pointer (e.g., in some C-constructed
structure) and want to call it from your Forth program, you could use
the structures as described above by defining a macro.  Or you use
@code{c-funptr}.

doc-c-funptr

Let us assume that there is a C function pointer type @code{func1}
defined in some header file @file{func1.h}, and you know that these
functions take one integer argument and return an integer result; and
you want to call functions through such pointers.  Just define

@example
\c #include <func1.h>
c-funptr call-func1 @{((func1)ptr)@} n -- n
@end example

and then you can call a function pointed to by, say @code{func1a} as
follows:

@example
-5 func1a call-func1 .
@end example

The Forth word @code{call-func1} is similar to @code{execute}, except
that it takes a C @code{func1} pointer instead of a Forth execution
token, and it is specific to @code{func1} pointers.  For each type of
function pointer you want to call from Forth, you have to define
a separate calling word.

@node Defining library interfaces, Declaring OS-level libraries, Calling C function pointers, C Interface
@subsection Defining library interfaces
@cindex giving a name to a library interface
@cindex library interface names

You can give a name to a bunch of C function declarations (a library
interface), as follows:

@example
c-library lseek-lib
\c #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
...
end-c-library
@end example

The effect of giving such a name to the interface is that the names of
the generated files will contain that name, and when you use the
interface a second time, it will use the existing files instead of
generating and compiling them again, saving you time.  The generated
file contains a 128 bit hash (not cryptographically safe, but good
enough for that purpose) of the source code, so changing the
declarations will cause a new compilation.  Normally these files are
cached in @file{$HOME/.gforth/}@var{architecture}@file{/libcc-named}, so
if you experience problems or have other reasons to force a
recompilation, you can delete the files there.

Note that you should use @code{c-library} before everything else having
anything to do with that library, as it resets some setup stuff.  The
idea is that the typical use is to put each
@code{c-library}...@code{end-c-library} unit in its own file, and to be
able to include these files in any order.  All other words dealing with
the C interface are hidden in the vocabulary @code{c-lib}, which is put on top o the search stack by @code{c-library} and removed by @code{end-c-library}.

Note that the library name is not allocated in the dictionary and
therefore does not shadow dictionary names.  It is used in the file
system, so you have to use naming conventions appropriate for file
systems.  The name is also used as part of the C symbols, but characters
outside the legal C symbol names are replaced with underscores.  Also,
you shall not call a function you declare after @code{c-library} before
you perform @code{end-c-library}.

A major benefit of these named library interfaces is that, once they are
generated, the tools used to generated them (in particular, the C
compiler and libtool) are no longer needed, so the interface can be used
even on machines that do not have the tools installed.  The build system
of Gforth can even cross-compile these libraries, so that the libraries
are available for platforms on which build tools aren't installed.

@subsection Declaring OS-level libraries
@cindex Shared libraries in C interface
@cindex Dynamically linked libraries in C interface
@cindex Libraries in C interface

For calling some C functions, you need to link with a specific
OS-level library that contains that function.  E.g., the @code{sin}
function requires linking a special library by using the command line
switch @code{-lm}.  In our C interface you do the equivalent thing by
calling @code{add-lib} as follows:

@example
clear-libs
s" m" add-lib
\c #include <math.h>
c-function sin sin r -- r
@end example

First, you clear any libraries that may have been declared earlier
(you don't need them for @code{sin}); then you add the @code{m}
library (actually @code{libm.so} or somesuch) to the currently
declared libraries; you can add as many as you need.  Finally you
declare the function as shown above.  Typically you will use the same
set of library declarations for many function declarations; you need
to write only one set for that, right at the beginning.

Note that you must not call @code{clear-libs} inside
@code{c-library...end-c-library}; however, @code{c-library} performs
the function of @code{clear-libs}, so @code{clear-libs} is not
necessary, and you usually want to put @code{add-lib} calls inside
@code{c-library...end-c-library}.

@node Callbacks, C interface internals, Declaring OS-level libraries, C Interface
@subsection Callbacks
@cindex Callback functions written in Forth
@cindex C function pointers to Forth words

In some cases you have to pass a function pointer to a C function,
i.e., the library wants to call back to your application (and the
pointed-to function is called a callback function).  You can pass the
address of an existing C function (that you get with @code{lib-sym},
@pxref{Low-Level C Interface Words}), but if there is no appropriate C
function, you probably want to define the function as a Forth word.
Then you need to generate a callback as described below:

You can generate C callbacks from Forth code with @code{c-callback}.

doc-c-callback
doc-c-callback-thread

This precompiles a number of callback functions (up to the value
@code{callback#}).  The prototype of the C function is deduced from
its Forth signature.  If this is not sufficient, you can add types in
curly braces after the Forth type.

@example
c-callback vector4double: f f f f -- void
c-callback vector4single: f@{float@} f@{float@} f@{float@} f@{float@} -- void
@end example

@c I don't understand the existing callback interface from the example - anton

@node C interface internals, Low-Level C Interface Words, Callbacks, C Interface
@subsection How the C interface works

The documented C interface works by generating a C code out of the
declarations.

In particular, for every Forth word declared with @code{c-function},
it generates a wrapper function in C that takes the Forth data from
the Forth stacks, and calls the target C function with these data as
arguments.  The C compiler then performs an implicit conversion
between the Forth type from the stack, and the C type for the
parameter, which is given by the C function prototype.  After the C
function returns, the return value is likewise implicitly converted to
a Forth type and written back on the stack.

The @code{\c} lines are literally included in the C code (but without
the @code{\c}), and provide the necessary declarations so that the C
compiler knows the C types and has enough information to perform the
conversion.

These wrapper functions are eventually compiled and dynamically linked
into Gforth, and then they can be called.

The libraries added with @code{add-lib} are used in the compile
command line to specify dependent libraries with @code{-l@var{lib}},
causing these libraries to be dynamically linked when the wrapper
function is linked.

SWIG, the Simple Wrapper Interface Generator, is used to create C interfaces for a lot of programming languages.
The SWIG version extended with a Forth module can be found on @uref{https://github.com/GeraldWodni/swig,github}.

@subsubsection Basic operation
C-headers are parsed and converted to Forth-Sourcecode which uses the previously describe C interface functions.

@subsubsection Detailed operation:
@enumerate 1
@item Select a target, in this example we are using @code{example.h}
@item Create an interface file for the header. This can be used to pass options, switches and define variables.
    In the simplest case it just instructs to translate all of @code{example.h}:@/
@example
%module example
%insert("include")
@{
    #include "example.h"
@}
%include "example.h"
@end example
@item Use SWIG to create a @code{.fsi-c} file. @*
    @code{swig -forth -stackcomments -use-structs -enumcomments -o example-fsi.c example.i}. @*
    FSI stands ``Forth Source Independent'' meaning it can be transferred to any host having a C-compiler. SWIG is not required past this point.
@item On the target machine compile the @code{.fsi-c} file to a @code{.fsx} (x stands for executable) @*
    @code{gcc -o example.fsx example-fsi.c} @*
    The compilation will resolve all constants to the values on the target.
@item The last step is to run the executable and capture its output to a @code{.fs} ``Forth Source'' file. @*
    @code{./example.fsx -gforth > example.fs} @*
    This code can now be used on the target platform.

@subsection Definitions in assembly language

Gforth provides ways to implement words in assembly language (using
@code{abi-code}...@code{end-code}), and also ways to define defining
words with arbitrary run-time behaviour (like @code{does>}), where
(unlike @code{does>}) the behaviour is not defined in Forth, but in
assembly language (with @code{;code}).

However, the machine-independent nature of Gforth poses a few
problems: First of all, Gforth runs on several architectures, so it
can provide no standard assembler. It does provide assemblers for
several of the architectures it runs on, though.  Moreover, you can
use a system-independent assembler in Gforth, or compile machine code
directly with @code{,} and @code{c,}.

Another problem is that the virtual machine registers of Gforth (the
stack pointers and the virtual machine instruction pointer) depend on
the installation and engine.  Also, which registers are free to use
also depend on the installation and engine.  So any code written to
run in the context of the Gforth virtual machine is essentially
limited to the installation and engine it was developed for (it may
run elsewhere, but you cannot rely on that).

Fortunately, you can define @code{abi-code} words in Gforth that are
portable to any Gforth running on a platform with the same calling
convention (ABI); typically this means portability to the same
architecture/OS combination, sometimes crossing OS boundaries).

doc-assembler
doc-init-asm
doc-abi-code
doc-;abi-code
doc-end-code
doc-code
doc-;code
doc-flush-icache


If @code{flush-icache} does not work correctly, @code{abi-code} words
etc. will not work (reliably), either.

The typical usage of these words can be shown most easily by analogy
to the equivalent high-level defining words:

@example
: foo                              abi-code foo
   <high-level Forth words>              <assembler>
;                                  end-code
                                
: bar                              : bar
   <high-level Forth words>           <high-level Forth words>
   CREATE                             CREATE
      <high-level Forth words>           <high-level Forth words>
   DOES>                              ;code
      <high-level Forth words>           <assembler>
;                                  end-code
@end example

For using @code{abi-code}, take a look at the ABI documentation of
your platform to see how the parameters are passed (so you know where
you get the stack pointers) and how the return value is passed (so you
know where the data stack pointer is returned).  The ABI documentation
also tells you which registers are saved by the caller (caller-saved),
so you are free to destroy them in your code, and which registers have
to be preserved by the called word (callee-saved), so you have to save
them before using them, and restore them afterwards.  For some
architectures and OSs we give short summaries of the parts of the
calling convention in the appropriate sections.  More
reverse-engineering oriented people can also find out about the
passing and returning of the stack pointers through @code{see
abi-call}.

Most ABIs pass the parameters through registers, but some (in
particular the most common 386 (aka IA-32) calling conventions) pass
them on the architectural stack.  The common ABIs all pass the return
value in a register.

Other things you need to know for using @code{abi-code} is that both
the data and the FP stack grow downwards (towards lower addresses) in
Gforth, with @code{1 cells} size per cell, and @code{1 floats} size
per FP value.

Here's an example of using @code{abi-code} on the 386 architecture:

@example
abi-code my+ ( n1 n2 -- n )
4 sp d) ax mov \ sp into return reg
ax )    cx mov \ tos
4 #     ax add \ update sp (pop)
cx    ax ) add \ sec = sec+tos
ret            \ return from my+
end-code
@end example

An AMD64 variant of this example can be found in @ref{AMD64 Assembler}.

Here's a 386 example that deals with FP values:

@example
abi-code my-f+ ( r1 r2 -- r )
8 sp d) cx mov  \ load address of fp
cx )    dx mov  \ load fp
.fl dx )   fld  \ r2
8 #     dx add  \ update fp
.fl dx )   fadd \ r1+r2
.fl dx )   fstp \ store r
dx    cx ) mov  \ store new fp
4 sp d) ax mov  \ sp into return reg
ret             \ return from my-f+
end-code
@end example


@node Common Assembler, Common Disassembler, Assembler Definitions, Assembler and Code Words
@subsection Common Assembler

The assemblers in Gforth generally use a postfix syntax, i.e., the
instruction name follows the operands.

The operands are passed in the usual order (the same that is used in the
manual of the architecture).  Since they all are Forth words, they have
to be separated by spaces; you can also use Forth words to compute the
operands.

The instruction names usually end with a @code{,}.  This makes it easier
to visually separate instructions if you put several of them on one
line; it also avoids shadowing other Forth words (e.g., @code{and}).

Registers are usually specified by number; e.g., (decimal) @code{11}
specifies registers R11 and F11 on the Alpha architecture (which one,
depends on the instruction).  The usual names are also available, e.g.,
@code{s2} for R11 on Alpha.

Control flow is specified similar to normal Forth code (@pxref{Arbitrary
control structures}), with @code{if,}, @code{ahead,}, @code{then,},
@code{begin,}, @code{until,}, @code{again,}, @code{cs-roll},
@code{cs-pick}, @code{else,}, @code{while,}, and @code{repeat,}.  The
conditions are specified in a way specific to each assembler.

The rest of this section is of interest mainly for those who want to
define @code{code} words (instead of the more portable @code{abi-code}
words).

Note that the register assignments of the Gforth engine can change
between Gforth versions, or even between different compilations of the
same Gforth version (e.g., if you use a different GCC version).  If
you are using @code{CODE} instead of @code{ABI-CODE}, and you want to
refer to Gforth's registers (e.g., the stack pointer or TOS), I
recommend defining your own words for referring to these registers, and
using them later on; then you can adapt to a changed register
assignment.

The most common use of these registers is to end a @code{code}
definition with a dispatch to the next word (the @code{next} routine).
A portable way to do this is to jump to @code{' noop >code-address}
(of course, this is less efficient than integrating the @code{next}
code and scheduling it well).  When using @code{ABI-CODE}, you can
just assemble a normal subroutine return (but make sure you return the
data stack pointer).

Another difference between Gforth versions is that the top of stack is
kept in memory in @code{gforth} and, on most platforms, in a register
in @code{gforth-fast}.  For @code{ABI-CODE} definitions, any stack
caching registers are guaranteed to be flushed to the stack, allowing
you to reliably access the top of stack in memory.

@node  Common Disassembler, 386 Assembler, Common Assembler, Assembler and Code Words
@subsection Common Disassembler
@cindex disassembler, general
@cindex gdb disassembler

You can disassemble a @code{code} word with @code{see}
(@pxref{Debugging}).  You can disassemble a section of memory with

doc-discode

There are two kinds of disassembler for Gforth: The Forth disassembler
(available on some CPUs) and the gdb disassembler (available on
platforms with @command{gdb} and @command{mktemp}).  If both are
available, the Forth disassembler is used by default.  If you prefer
the gdb disassembler, say

@example
' disasm-gdb is discode
@end example

If neither is available, @code{discode} performs @code{dump}.

The Forth disassembler generally produces output that can be fed into the
assembler (i.e., same syntax, etc.).  It also includes additional
information in comments.  In particular, the address of the instruction
is given in a comment before the instruction.

The gdb disassembler produces output in the same format as the gdb
@code{disassemble} command (@pxref{Machine Code,,Source and machine
code,gdb,Debugging with GDB}), in the default flavour (AT&T syntax for
the 386 and AMD64 architectures).

@code{See} may display more or less than the actual code of the word,
because the recognition of the end of the code is unreliable.  You can
use @code{discode} if it did not display enough.  It may display more, if
the code word is not immediately followed by a named word.  If you have
something else there, you can follow the word with @code{align latest ,}
to ensure that the end is recognized.

@node 386 Assembler, AMD64 Assembler, Common Disassembler, Assembler and Code Words
@subsection 386 Assembler

The 386 assembler included in Gforth was written by Bernd Paysan, it's
available under GPL, and originally part of bigFORTH.

The 386 disassembler included in Gforth was written by Andrew McKewan
and is in the public domain.

The disassembler displays code in an Intel-like prefix syntax.

The assembler uses a postfix syntax with AT&T-style parameter order
(i.e., destination last).

The assembler includes all instruction of the Athlon, i.e. 486 core
instructions, Pentium and PPro extensions, floating point, MMX, 3Dnow!,
but not ISSE. It's an integrated 16- and 32-bit assembler. Default is 32
bit, you can switch to 16 bit with .86 and back to 32 bit with .386.

There are several prefixes to switch between different operation sizes,
@code{.b} for byte accesses, @code{.w} for word accesses, @code{.d} for
double-word accesses. Addressing modes can be switched with @code{.wa}
for 16 bit addresses, and @code{.da} for 32 bit addresses. You don't
need a prefix for byte register names (@code{AL} et al).

For floating point operations, the prefixes are @code{.fs} (IEEE
single), @code{.fl} (IEEE double), @code{.fx} (extended), @code{.fw}
(word), @code{.fd} (double-word), and @code{.fq} (quad-word).  The
default is @code{.fx}, so you need to specify @code{.fl} explicitly
when dealing with Gforth FP values.

The MMX opcodes don't have size prefixes, they are spelled out like in
the Intel assembler. Instead of move from and to memory, there are
PLDQ/PLDD and PSTQ/PSTD.

The registers lack the 'e' prefix; even in 32 bit mode, eax is called
ax.  Immediate values are indicated by postfixing them with @code{#},
e.g., @code{3 #}.  Here are some examples of addressing modes in various
syntaxes:

@example
Gforth          Intel (NASM)   AT&T (gas)      Name
.w ax           ax             %ax             register (16 bit)
ax              eax            %eax            register (32 bit)
3 #             offset 3       $3              immediate
1000 #)         byte ptr 1000  1000            displacement
bx )            [ebx]          (%ebx)          base
100 di d)       100[edi]       100(%edi)       base+displacement
20 ax *4 i#)    20[eax*4]      20(,%eax,4)     (index*scale)+displacement
di ax *4 i)     [edi][eax*4]   (%edi,%eax,4)   base+(index*scale)
4 bx cx di)     4[ebx][ecx]    4(%ebx,%ecx)    base+index+displacement
12 sp ax *2 di) 12[esp][eax*2] 12(%esp,%eax,2) base+(index*scale)+displacement
@end example

You can use @code{L)} and @code{LI)} instead of @code{D)} and
@code{DI)} to enforce 32-bit displacement fields (useful for
later patching).

Some example of instructions are:

@example
ax bx mov             \ move ebx,eax
3 # ax mov            \ mov eax,3
100 di d) ax mov      \ mov eax,100[edi]
4 bx cx di) ax mov    \ mov eax,4[ebx][ecx]
.w ax bx mov          \ mov bx,ax
@end example

The following forms are supported for binary instructions:

@example
<reg> <reg> <inst>
<n> # <reg> <inst>
<mem> <reg> <inst>
<reg> <mem> <inst>
<n> # <mem> <inst>
@end example

The shift/rotate syntax is:

@example
<reg/mem> 1 # shl \ shortens to shift without immediate
<reg/mem> 4 # shl
<reg/mem> cl shl
@end example

Precede string instructions (@code{movs} etc.) with @code{.b} to get
the byte version.

The control structure words @code{IF} @code{UNTIL} etc. must be preceded
by one of these conditions: @code{vs vc u< u>= 0= 0<> u<= u> 0< 0>= ps
pc < >= <= >}. (Note that most of these words shadow some Forth words
when @code{assembler} is in front of @code{forth} in the search path,
e.g., in @code{code} words).  Currently the control structure words use
one stack item, so you have to use @code{roll} instead of @code{cs-roll}
to shuffle them (you can also use @code{swap} etc.).

Based on the Intel ABI (used in Linux), @code{abi-code} words can find
the data stack pointer at @code{4 sp d)}, and the address of the FP
stack pointer at @code{8 sp d)}; the data stack pointer is returned in
@code{ax}; @code{Ax}, @code{cx}, and @code{dx} are caller-saved, so
you do not need to preserve their values inside the word.  You can
return from the word with @code{ret}, the parameters are cleaned up by
the caller.

For examples of 386 @code{abi-code} words, see @ref{Assembler Definitions}.


@node AMD64 Assembler, Alpha Assembler, 386 Assembler, Assembler and Code Words
@subsection AMD64 (x86_64) Assembler

The AMD64 assembler is a slightly modified version of the 386
assembler, and as such shares most of the syntax.  Two new prefixes,
@code{.q} and @code{.qa}, are provided to select 64-bit operand and
address sizes respectively.  64-bit sizes are the default, so normally
you only have to use the other prefixes.  Also there are additional
register operands @code{R8}-@code{R15}.

The registers lack the 'e' or 'r' prefix; even in 64 bit mode,
@code{rax} is called @code{ax}.  Additional register operands are
available to refer to the lowest-significant byte of all registers:
@code{R8L}-@code{R15L}, @code{SPL}, @code{BPL}, @code{SIL},
@code{DIL}.

The Linux-AMD64 calling convention is to pass the first 6 integer
parameters in rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8 and r9 and to return the result
in rax and rdx; to pass the first 8 FP parameters in xmm0--xmm7 and to
return FP results in xmm0--xmm1.  So @code{abi-code} words get the
data stack pointer in @code{di} and the address of the FP stack
pointer in @code{si}, and return the data stack pointer in @code{ax}.
The other caller-saved registers are: r10, r11, xmm8-xmm15.  This
calling convention reportedly is also used in other non-Microsoft OSs.
@c source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#AMD64_ABI_convention

@c source: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9b372w95(v=VS.90).aspx
Windows x64 passes the first four integer parameters in rcx, rdx, r8
and r9 and return the integer result in rax.  The other caller-saved
registers are r10 and r11.

On the Linux platform, according to
@url{https://uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf} page 21 the registers AX
CX DX SI DI R8 R9 R10 R11 are available for scratch.

The addressing modes for the AMD64 are:

@example
\ running word A produces a memory error as the registers are not initialised ;-)
ABI-CODE A  ( -- )
    500        #               AX  MOV     \ immediate

@subsection Alpha Assembler

The Alpha assembler and disassembler were originally written by Bernd
Thallner.

The register names @code{a0}--@code{a5} are not available to avoid
shadowing hex numbers.

Immediate forms of arithmetic instructions are distinguished by a
@code{#} just before the @code{,}, e.g., @code{and#,} (note: @code{lda,}
does not count as arithmetic instruction).

You have to specify all operands to an instruction, even those that
other assemblers consider optional, e.g., the destination register for
@code{br,}, or the destination register and hint for @code{jmp,}.

You can specify conditions for @code{if,} by removing the first @code{b}
and the trailing @code{,} from a branch with a corresponding name; e.g.,

@example
11 fgt if, \ if F11>0e
  ...
endif,
@end example

@code{fbgt,} gives @code{fgt}.

@subsection MIPS assembler

The MIPS assembler was originally written by Christian Pirker.

Currently the assembler and disassembler covers most of the MIPS32
architecture and doesn't support FP instructions.

The register names @code{$a0}--@code{$a3} are not available to avoid
shadowing hex numbers.  Use register numbers @code{$4}--@code{$7}
instead.

Nothing distinguishes registers from immediate values.  Use explicit
opcode names with the @code{i} suffix for instructions with immediate
argument.  E.g. @code{addiu,} in place of @code{addu,}.

Where the architecture manual specifies several formats for the
instruction (e.g., for @code{jalr,}),use the one with more arguments
(i.e. two for @code{jalr,}).  When in doubt, see
@code{arch/mips/testasm.fs} for an example of correct use.

Branches and jumps in the MIPS architecture have a delay slot.  You
have to fill it manually (the simplest way is to use @code{nop,}), the
assembler does not do it for you (unlike @command{as}).  Even
@code{if,}, @code{ahead,}, @code{until,}, @code{again,},
@code{while,}, @code{else,} and @code{repeat,} need a delay slot.
Since @code{begin,} and @code{then,} just specify branch targets, they
are not affected.  For branches the argument specifying the target is
a relative address.  Add the address of the delay slot to get the
absolute address.

Note that you must not put branches nor jumps (nor control-flow
instructions) into the delay slot.  Also it is a bad idea to put
pseudo-ops such as @code{li,} into a delay slot, as these may expand
to several instructions.  The MIPS I architecture also had load delay
slots, and newer MIPSes still have restrictions on using @code{mfhi,}
and @code{mflo,}.  Be careful to satisfy these restrictions, the
assembler does not do it for you.

Some example of instructions are:

@example
$ra  12 $sp  sw,         \ sw    ra,12(sp)
$4    8 $s0  lw,         \ lw    a0,8(s0)
$v0  $0  lui,            \ lui   v0,0x0
$s0  $s4  $12  addiu,    \ addiu s0,s4,0x12
$s0  $s4  $4  addu,      \ addu  s0,s4,$a0
$ra  $t9  jalr,          \ jalr  t9
@end example

You can specify the conditions for @code{if,} etc. by taking a
conditional branch and leaving away the @code{b} at the start and the
@code{,} at the end.  E.g.,

@example
4 5 eq if,
  ... \ do something if $4 equals $5
then,
@end example

The calling conventions for 32-bit MIPS machines is to pass the first
4 arguments in registers @code{$4}..@code{$7}, and to use
@code{$v0}-@code{$v1} for return values.  In addition to these
registers, it is ok to clobber registers @code{$t0}-@code{$t8} without
saving and restoring them.

If you use @code{jalr,} to call into dynamic library routines, you
must first load the called function's address into @code{$t9}, which
is used by position-indirect code to do relative memory accesses.

Here is an example of a MIPS32 @code{abi-code} word:

@example
abi-code my+  ( n1 n2 -- n3 )
  \ SP passed in $4, returned in $v0
  $t0  4 $4  lw,         \ load n1, n2 from stack
  $t1  0 $4  lw,    
  $t0  $t0  $t1  addu,   \ add n1+n2, result in $t0
  $t0  4 $4  sw,         \ store result (overwriting n1)
  $ra  jr,               \ return to caller
  $v0  $4  4  addiu,     \ (delay slot) return uptated SP in $v0
end-code
@end example

@node PowerPC assembler, ARM Assembler, MIPS assembler, Assembler and Code Words
@subsection PowerPC assembler

The PowerPC assembler and disassembler were contributed by Michal
Revucky.

This assembler does not follow the convention of ending mnemonic names
with a ``,'', so some mnemonic names shadow regular Forth words (in
particular: @code{and or xor fabs}); so if you want to use the Forth
words, you have to make them visible first, e.g., with @code{also
forth}.

Registers are referred to by their number, e.g., @code{9} means the
integer register 9 or the FP register 9 (depending on the
instruction).

Because there is no way to distinguish registers from immediate values,
you have to explicitly use the immediate forms of instructions, i.e.,
@code{addi,}, not just @code{add,}.

The assembler and disassembler usually support the most general form
of an instruction, but usually not the shorter forms (especially for
branches).


@node ARM Assembler, Other assemblers, PowerPC assembler, Assembler and Code Words
@subsection ARM Assembler

The ARM assembler includes all instruction of ARM architecture version
4, and the BLX instruction from architecture 5.  It does not (yet)
have support for Thumb instructions.  It also lacks support for any
co-processors.

The assembler uses a postfix syntax with the same operand order as
used in the ARM Architecture Reference Manual.  Mnemonics are suffixed
by a comma.

Registers are specified by their names @code{r0} through @code{r15},
with the aliases @code{pc}, @code{lr}, @code{sp}, @code{ip} and
@code{fp} provided for convenience.  Note that @code{ip} refers to
the``intra procedure call scratch register'' (@code{r12}) and does not
refer to an instruction pointer.  @code{sp} refers to the ARM ABI
stack pointer (@code{r13}) and not the Forth stack pointer.

Condition codes can be specified anywhere in the instruction, but will
be most readable if specified just in front of the mnemonic.  The 'S'
flag is not a separate word, but encoded into instruction mnemonics,
ie. just use @code{adds,} instead of @code{add,} if you want the
status register to be updated.

The following table lists the syntax of operands for general
instructions:

@example
Gforth          normal assembler      description
123 #           #123                  immediate

r12 r1 LSL      r12, LSL r1           shift left by register
r12 4 #LSR      r12, LSR #4           shift right by immediate
r12 r1 LSR      r12, LSR r1           shift right by register
r12 4 #ASR      r12, ASR #4           arithmetic shift right
r12 r1 ASR      r12, ASR r1           ... by register
r12 4 #ROR      r12, ROR #4           rotate right by immediate
r12 r1 ROR      r12, ROR r1           ... by register
r12 RRX         r12, RRX              rotate right with extend by 1
@end example

Memory operand syntax is listed in this table:

Register lists for load/store multiple instructions are started and
terminated by using the words @code{@{} and @code{@}} respectively.
Between braces, register names can be listed one by one or register
ranges can be formed by using the postfix operator @code{r-r}.  The
@code{^} flag is not encoded in the register list operand, but instead
directly encoded into the instruction mnemonic, ie. use @code{^ldm,}
and @code{^stm,}.

Addressing modes for load/store multiple are not encoded as
instruction suffixes, but instead specified like an addressing mode,
Use one of @code{DA}, @code{IA}, @code{DB}, @code{IB}, @code{DA!},
@code{IA!}, @code{DB!} or @code{IB!}.

The following table gives some examples:

@example
Gforth                           normal assembler
r4 ia  @{ r0 r7 r8 @}  stm,        stmia    r4, @{r0,r7,r8@}
r4 db!  @{ r0 r7 r8 @}  ldm,       ldmdb    r4!, @{r0,r7,r8@}
sp ia!  @{ r0 r15 r-r @}  ^ldm,    ldmfd    sp!, @{r0-r15@}^
@end example

Control structure words typical for Forth assemblers are available:
@code{if,} @code{ahead,} @code{then,} @code{else,} @code{begin,}
@code{until,} @code{again,} @code{while,} @code{repeat,}
@code{repeat-until,}.  Conditions are specified in front of these words:

@example
r1 r2 cmp,    \ compare r1 and r2
eq if,        \ equal?
   ...          \ code executed if r1 == r2
then,
@end example

Example of a definition using the ARM assembler:

@example

   \ arm abi: r0=SP, r1=&FP, r2,r3,r12 saved by caller
   r0 IA!  @{ r2 r3 @}  ldm,     \ pop r2 = n2, r3 = n1

If you want to contribute another assembler/disassembler, please contact
us (@email{anton@@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at}) to check if we have such
an assembler already.  If you are writing them from scratch, please use
a similar syntax style as the one we use (i.e., postfix, commas at the
end of the instruction names, @pxref{Common Assembler}); make the output
of the disassembler be valid input for the assembler, and keep the style
similar to the style we used.

Hints on implementation: The most important part is to have a good test
suite that contains all instructions.  Once you have that, the rest is
easy.  For actual coding you can take a look at
@file{arch/mips/disasm.fs} to get some ideas on how to use data for both
the assembler and disassembler, avoiding redundancy and some potential
bugs.  You can also look at that file (and @pxref{Advanced does> usage
example}) to get ideas how to factor a disassembler.

Start with the disassembler, because it's easier to reuse data from the
disassembler for the assembler than the other way round.

For the assembler, take a look at @file{arch/alpha/asm.fs}, which shows
how simple it can be.

@subsection Header fields
@cindex header fields

In Gforth 1.0 we switched to a new word header layout.  For a detailed
description, read: Bernd Paysan and M. Anton Ertl.
@cite{@uref{http://www.euroforth.org/ef19/papers/paysan.pdf,The new
Gforth header}}. In 35th EuroForth Conference, pages 5-20, 2019.
Since this paper was published, xt and nt have been changed to point
to the parameter field, like the body, but otherwise it is still
up-to-date.

This section explains just the data structure and the words used to
access it.  A header has the following fields:

@example
name
>f+c
>link
>cfa
>namehm
>body
@end example

Currently Gforth has the names shown above for
getting from the xt/nt/body to the field, but apart from the standard
@code{>body} they are not stable Gforth words.  Instead, we provide
access words.  Note that the documented access words have survived the
reorganization of the header layout.

Some of the words expect an nt, some expect an xt.  Given that both nt
and xt point to the body of a word, what is the difference?  For most
words, the xt and nt use the same header, and with nt=xt, they point
to the same place.  However, for a synonym (@pxref{Synonyms}) there is
a difference; consider the example

@example
create x
synonym y x
synonym z y
@end example

In this case the nt of @code{z} points to the body of @code{z}, while
the xt of @code{z} points to the body of @code{x}.  Words defined with
@code{alias} or @code{forward} (@pxref{Calls and returns}) also have different
nts and xts.

The name field is variable-length and is accessed with
@code{name>string} (@pxref{Name token}).

The @code{>f+c} field contains flags and the name length (count).  You
read the count with @code{name>string}, and the flags with
@word{compile-only?} and @word{obsolete?} (@pxref{Name token}).

The @code{>link} field contains a link to the previous word in the
same word list.  You can read it with @code{name>link} (@pxref{Name
token}).

The name, @code{>f+c} and @code{>link} fields are not present for
@code{noname} words, but @code{name>string} and @code{name>link} work
nevertheless, producing 0 0 and 0, respectively.

The @code{>cfa} field (aka code field) contains the code address used
for @code{execute}ing the word; you can read it with
@code{>code-address} and write it with @code{code-address!}
(@pxref{Threading Words}).

The @code{>namehm} field contains the address of the header methods
table, described below.  You access it by performing or accessing
header methods (@pxref{Header methods}).

The @code{>body} (aka parameter) field contains data or threaded code
specific to the word type; its length depends on the word type.  E.g.,
for a @code{constant} it contains a cell with the value of the
constant.  You can access it through @code{>body}
(@pxref{CREATE..DOES> details}), but this is only standard for words
you defined with @code{create}.

@node Header methods, Threading Words, Header fields, Carnal words
@subsection Header methods
@cindex header methods

The new Gforth word header is object-oriented and supports the
following methods (method selectors):

@example
.hm label method          overrider        field
          execute         set-execute      >cfa
opt:      opt-compile,    set-optimizer    >hmcompile,
to:       (to)            set-to           >hmto
extra:                                     >hmextra
>int:     name>interpret  set->int         >hm>int
>comp:    name>compile    set->comp        >hm>comp
>string:  name>string     set-name>string  >hm>string
>link:    name>link       set-name>link    >hm>link
@end example

Many of these words are not stable Gforth words, but Gforth has stable
higher-level words that we mention below.

You can look at the header methods of a word with

doc-.hm

Overrider (setter) words change the method implementation for the most
recent definition.  Quotations or closures restore the previous most
recent definition when they are completed, so they are not considered
most recent, and you can do things like:

@example
: my2dup over over ;
[: drop ]] over over [[ ;] set-optimizer
@end example

The @code{execute} method is actually stored in the @code{>cfa} field
in the header rather than in the header-methods table for performance
reasons; also it is implemented through a native-code address, while
the other methods are implemented by calling an xt.  The high-level
way to set this method is

doc-set-execute

To get a code address for use with @code{set-execute}, you can use
words like @code{docol:} or @code{>code-address}, @xref{Threading
Words}.

As an alternative to @code{set-execute}, there is also
@code{set-does>} (@pxref{User-defined Defining Words}), which takes an
xt.

Moreover, there are the low-level @code{code-address!} and
@code{definer!} (@pxref{Threading Words}).

The @code{opt-compile,} method is what @code{compile,} does on most
Gforth engines (@code{gforth-itc} uses @code{,} instead).  You can
define a more efficient implementation of @code{compile,} for the
current word with @code{set-optimizer} (@pxref{User-defined
compile-comma}).  Note that the end result must be equivalent to
@code{postpone literal postpone execute}.

As an example of the use of @code{set-optimizer}, consider the
following definition of @code{constant}:

@example
: constant ( n "name" -- ; name: -- n )
  create ,
  ['] @@ set-does>
;

5 constant five
: foo five ; see foo
@end example

The Forth system does not know that the value of a constant must not
be changed, and just sees a @code{create}d word (which can be changed
with @code{>body}), and @code{foo} first pushes the body address of
@code{five} and then fetches from there.  With @code{set-optimizer}
the definition of @code{constant} can be optimized as follows:

@example
: constant ( n "name" -- ; name: -- n )
  create ,
  ['] @@ set-does>
  [: >body @@ postpone literal ;] set-optimizer
;
@end example

Now @code{foo} contains the literal 5 rather than a call to
@code{five}.

Note that @code{set-execute} and @code{set-does>} perform
@code{set-optimizer} themselves in order to ensure that @code{execute}
and @code{compile,} agree, so if you want to add your own optimizer,
you should add it afterwards.

The @code{(to)} method and @code{set-to} are used for implementing
@code{to @emph{name}} semantics etc. (@pxref{Words with user-defined
TO etc.}).

The @code{>hmextra} field is used for cases where additional data
needs to be stored in the header methods table.  In particular, it
stores the xt passed to @code{set-does>} (and @code{does>} calls
@code{set-does>}) and the code address behind @code{;abi-code}.

The methods above all consume an xt, not an nt, but the override words
work on the most recent definition.  This means that if you use, e.g.,
@code{set-optimizer} on a synonym, the effect will probably not be
what you intended: When @code{compile,}ing the xt of the word, the
@code{opt-compile,} implementation of the original word will be used,
not the freshly-set one of the synonym.

The following methods consume an nt.

The @code{name>interpret} method is implemented as noop for most
words, except synonyms and similar words.

doc-set->int

The @code{name>compile} method produces the compilation semantics of
the nt.  By changing it with @code{set->comp}, you can change the
compilation semantics, but it's not as simple as just pushing the xt
of the desired compilation semantics, because of the stack effect of
@code{name>compile}.  Generally you should avoid changing the
compilation semantics, and if you do, use a higher-level word like
@code{immediate} or @code{interpret/compile:}, @xref{Combined words}.

doc-set->comp
doc-immediate?

@code{Name>string} and @code{Name>link} are methods in order to make
it possible to eliminate the name, @code{>f+c} and @code{link} fields
from noname headers, but still produce meaningful results when using
these words.  You will typically not change the implementations of
these methods except with @code{noname}, but we still have

doc-set-name>string
doc-set-name>link

@node Threading Words,  , Header methods, Carnal words
@subsection Threading Words
@cindex threading words

@cindex code field
@cindex CFA
@cindex code address
The terminology used here stems from indirect threaded Forth systems; in
such a system, the XT of a word is represented by the CFA (code field
address) of a word; the CFA points to a cell that contains the code
address.  The code address is the address of some machine code that
performs the run-time action of invoking the word (e.g., the
@code{dovar:} routine pushes the address of the body of the word (a
variable) on the stack).

These words provide access to code fields, code addresses and other
threading stuff in Gforth. It more or less abstracts away the
differences between direct and indirect threading.

Up to and including Gforth 0.7, the code address (plus, for
@code{does>}-defined words, the address returned by @code{>does-code})
was sufficient to know the type of the word.  However, since
Gforth-1.0 the behaviour or at least implementation of words like
@code{compile,} and @code{name>compile} can be determined
independently as described in @ref{Header methods}.

To create a code field and at the same time initialize the header
methods use @code{create-from} (@pxref{Creating from a prototype}).

The following words were designed before the introduction of header
methods, and are therefore not the best (and recommended) way to deal
with different word types in Gforth.

In an indirect threaded Forth, you can get the code address of @i{name}
with @code{' @i{name} @@}; in Gforth you can get it with @code{' @i{name}
>code-address}, independent of the threading method.

doc-threading-method
doc->code-address
doc-code-address!

The code addresses produced by various defining words are produced by
the following words:

doc-docol:
doc-docon:
doc-dovar:
doc-douser:
doc-dodefer:
doc-dofield:
doc-dovalue:
doc-dodoes:
doc-doabicode:

@cindex @code{does>}-code
For a word @i{X} defined with @code{set-does>}, the code address
points to @code{dodoes:}, and the @code{>hmextra} field of the header
methods contains the xt of the word that is called after pushing the
body address of @i{X}.

If you want to know whether a word is a @code{DOES>}-defined word, and
what Forth code it executes, @code{>does-code} tells you that:

doc->does-code

You can use the resulting @i{xt2} with @code{set-does>} (preferred) to
change the latest word or with

doc-does-code!

to change an arbitrary word.

@cindex definer
The following two words generalize @code{>code-address},
@code{>does-code}, @code{code-address!}, and @code{does-code!}:

doc->definer
doc-definer!

@code{Code-address!}, @code{does-code!}, and @code{definer!} update
the @code{opt-compile,} method to a somewhat generic compiler for that
word type (in particular, primitives get the slow
@code{general-compile,} method rather than the primitive-specific
@code{peephole-compile,}).

$400E6664 foo
@end example

The message identifying the error is @code{Invalid memory address}.  The
error happened when text-interpreting line 4 of the file
@file{./xxx.fs}. This line is given (it contains @code{bar}), and the
word on the line where the error happened, is pointed out (with
@code{>>>} and @code{<<<}).

The file containing the error was included in line 1 of @file{./yyy.fs},
and @file{yyy.fs} was included from a non-file (in this case, by giving
@file{yyy.fs} as command-line parameter to Gforth).

At the end of the error message you find a return stack dump that can be
interpreted as a backtrace (possibly empty). On top you find the top of
the return stack when the @code{throw} happened, and at the bottom you
find the return stack entry just above the return stack of the topmost
text interpreter.

To the right of most return stack entries you see a guess for the word
that pushed that return stack entry as its return address. This gives a
backtrace. In our case we see that @code{bar} called @code{foo}, and
@code{foo} called @code{@@} (and @code{@@} had an @emph{Invalid memory
address} exception).

Note that the backtrace is not perfect: We don't know which return stack
entries are return addresses (so we may get false positives); and in
some cases (e.g., for @code{abort"}) we cannot determine from the return
address the word that pushed the return address, so for some return
addresses you see no names in the return stack dump.

@cindex @code{catch} and backtraces
The return stack dump represents the return stack at the time when a
specific @code{throw} was executed.  In programs that make use of
@code{catch}, it is not necessarily clear which @code{throw} should be
used for the return stack dump (e.g., consider one @code{throw} that
indicates an error, which is caught, and during recovery another error
happens; which @code{throw} should be used for the stack dump?).
Gforth presents the return stack dump for the first @code{throw} after
the last executed (not returned-to) @code{catch} or @code{nothrow};
this works well in the usual case. To get the right backtrace, you
usually want to insert @code{nothrow} or @code{['] false catch 2drop}
after a @code{catch} if the error is not rethrown.

@cindex @code{gforth-fast} and backtraces
@cindex @code{gforth-fast}, difference from @code{gforth}
@cindex backtraces with @code{gforth-fast}
@cindex return stack dump with @code{gforth-fast}
@code{Gforth} is able to do a return stack dump for throws generated
from primitives (e.g., invalid memory address, stack empty etc.);
@code{gforth-fast} is only able to do a return stack dump from a
directly called @code{throw} (including @code{abort} etc.).  Given an
exception caused by a primitive in @code{gforth-fast}, you will
typically see no return stack dump at all; however, if the exception is
caught by @code{catch} (e.g., for restoring some state), and then
@code{throw}n again, the return stack dump will be for the first such
@code{throw}.

@code{gforth-fast} also does not attempt to differentiate between
division by zero and division overflow, because that costs time in every
division.

@section @file{ans-report.fs}: Report the words used, sorted by wordset
@cindex @file{ans-report.fs}
@cindex report the words used in your program
@cindex words used in your program

If you want to label a Forth program as Standard Program, you must
document which wordsets the program uses.

The @file{ans-report.fs} tool makes it easy for you to determine which
words from which wordset and which non-standard words your application
uses. You simply have to include @file{ans-report.fs} before loading the
program you want to check. After loading your program, you can get the
report with @code{print-ans-report}. A typical use is to run this as
batch job like this:
@example
gforth ans-report.fs myprog.fs -e "print-ans-report bye"
@end example

The output looks like this (for @file{compat/control.fs}):
@example
The program uses the following words
from CORE :
: POSTPONE THEN ; immediate ?dup IF 0= 
from BLOCK-EXT :
\ 
from FILE :
( 
@end example

@file{ans-report.fs} reports both Forth-94 and Forth-2012 wordsets.
For words that are in both standards, it reports the wordset without
suffix (e.g., @code{CORE-EXT}).  For Forth-2012-only words, it reports
the wordset with a @code{-2012} suffix (e.g., @code{CORE-EXT-2012});
and likewise for the words that are Forth-94-only (i.e., that have
been removed in Forth-2012).

@subsection Caveats

Note that @file{ans-report.fs} just checks which words are used, not
whether they are used in a standard-conforming way!

Some words are defined in several wordsets in the
standard. @file{ans-report.fs} reports them for only one of the
wordsets, and not necessarily the one you expect. It depends on usage
which wordset is the right one to specify. E.g., if you only use the
compilation semantics of @code{S"}, it is a Core word; if you also use
its interpretation semantics, it is a File word.

@cindex items on the stack after interpretation

Sometimes you notice that, after loading a file, there are items left
on the stack.  The tool @file{depth-changes.fs} helps you find out
quickly where in the file these stack items are coming from.

The simplest way of using @file{depth-changes.fs} is to include it
before the file(s) you want to check, e.g.:

@example
gforth depth-changes.fs my-file.fs
@end example

This will compare the stack depths of the data and FP stack at every
empty line (in interpretation state) against these depths at the last
empty line (in interpretation state).  If the depths are not equal,
the position in the file and the stack contents are printed with
@code{~~} (@pxref{Debugging}).  This indicates that a stack depth
change has occurred in the paragraph of non-empty lines before the
indicated line.  It is a good idea to leave an empty line at the end
of the file, so the last paragraph is checked, too.

Checking only at empty lines usually works well, but sometimes you
have big blocks of non-empty lines (e.g., when building a big table),
and you want to know where in this block the stack depth changed.  You
can check all interpreted lines with

@example
gforth depth-changes.fs -e "' all-lines is depth-changes-filter" my-file.fs
@end example

This checks the stack depth at every end-of-line.  So the depth change
occurred in the line reported by the @code{~~} (not in the line
before).

Note that, while this offers better accuracy in indicating where the
stack depth changes, it will often report many intentional stack depth
changes (e.g., when an interpreted computation stretches across
several lines).  You can suppress the checking of some lines by
putting backslashes at the end of these lines (not followed by white
space), and using

@example
gforth depth-changes.fs -e "' most-lines is depth-changes-filter" my-file.fs
@end example

@cindex system documentation
In addition, Standard Forth systems are required to document certain
implementation choices. This chapter tries to meet these requirements
for the Forth-94 standard.  For the Forth-2012 standard, we decided to
produce the additional documentation only if there is demand.  So if
you are really missing this documentation, please let us know.

In many cases, the following documentation gives a way to ask the
system for the information instead of providing the information
directly, in particular, if the information depends on the processor,
the operating system or the installation options chosen, or if they
are likely to change during the maintenance of Gforth.

@comment The framework for the rest has been taken from pfe.

This is modeled on the GNU readline library (@pxref{Readline

producing a full word completion every time you type it (instead of
producing the common prefix of all completions). @xref{Command-line editing}.

@item character set:
@cindex character set
The character set of your computer and display device. Gforth is
8-bit-clean (but some other component in your system may make trouble).

@item Character-aligned address requirements:
@cindex character-aligned address requirements
installation-dependent. Currently a character is represented by a C
@code{unsigned char}; in the future we might switch to @code{wchar_t}
(Comments on that requested).

@item character-set extensions and matching of names:
@cindex character-set extensions and matching of names
@cindex case-sensitivity for name lookup
@cindex name lookup, case-sensitivity
@cindex locale and case-sensitivity
Any character except the ASCII NUL character can be used in a
name. Matching is case-insensitive (except in @code{TABLE}s). The
matching is performed using the C library function @code{strncasecmp}, whose
function is probably influenced by the locale. E.g., the @code{C} locale
does not know about accents and umlauts, so they are matched
case-sensitively in that locale. For portability reasons it is best to
write programs such that they work in the @code{C} locale. Then one can
use libraries written by a Polish programmer (who might use words
containing ISO Latin-2 encoded characters) and by a French programmer
(ISO Latin-1) in the same program (of course, @code{WORDS} will produce
funny results for some of the words (which ones, depends on the font you
are using)). Also, the locale you prefer may not be available in other
operating systems. Hopefully, Unicode will solve these problems one day.

@item conditions under which control characters match a space delimiter:
@cindex space delimiters
@cindex control characters as delimiters
If @code{word} is called with the space character as a delimiter, all
white-space characters (as identified by the C macro @code{isspace()})
are delimiters. @code{Parse}, on the other hand, treats space like other
delimiters.  @code{Parse-name}, which is used by the outer
interpreter (aka text interpreter) by default, treats all white-space
characters as delimiters.

@item format of the control-flow stack:
@cindex control-flow stack, format
The data stack is used as control-flow stack. The size of a control-flow
stack item in cells is given by the constant @code{cs-item-size}. At the
time of this writing, an item consists of a (pointer to a) locals list
(third), an address in the code (second), and a tag for identifying the
item (TOS). The following tags are used: @code{defstart},
@code{live-orig}, @code{dead-orig}, @code{dest}, @code{do-dest},
@code{scopestart}.

@item conversion of digits > 35
@cindex digits > 35
The characters @code{[\]^_'} are the digits with the decimal value
36@minus{}41. There is no way to input many of the larger digits.

@item display after input terminates in @code{ACCEPT} and @code{EXPECT}:
@cindex @code{EXPECT}, display after end of input
@cindex @code{ACCEPT}, display after end of input
The cursor is moved to the end of the entered string. If the input is
terminated using the @kbd{Return} key, a space is typed.

@item exception abort sequence of @code{ABORT"}:
@cindex exception abort sequence of @code{ABORT"}
@cindex @code{ABORT"}, exception abort sequence
The error string is stored into the variable @code{abort-string} and a
@code{-2 throw} is performed.

@item input line terminator:
@cindex input line terminator
@cindex line terminator on input
@cindex newline character on input
For interactive input, @kbd{C-m} (CR) and @kbd{C-j} (LF) terminate
lines. One of these characters is typically produced when you type the
@kbd{Enter} or @kbd{Return} key.

@item maximum size of a counted string:

@item method of selecting the user input device:
@cindex user input device, method of selecting
The user input device is the standard input. There is currently no way to

@item method of selecting the user output device:
@cindex user output device, method of selecting
@code{EMIT} and @code{TYPE} output to the file-id stored in the value

Varies. You can determine the size at a specific time using @code{lp@@
tib - .}. It is shared with the locals stack and TIBs of files that
include the current file. You can change the amount of space for TIBs
and locals stack at Gforth startup with the command line option
@code{-l}.

@item size of the pictured numeric output buffer:
@cindex size of the pictured numeric output buffer

@cindex @code{PAD} size
The remainder of dictionary space. @code{unused pad here - - .}.

@item system case-sensitivity characteristics:
@cindex case-sensitivity characteristics
Dictionary searches are case-insensitive (except in
@code{TABLE}s). However, as explained above under @i{character-set
extensions}, the matching for non-ASCII characters is determined by the
locale you are using. In the default @code{C} locale all non-ASCII
characters are matched case-sensitively.

@item system prompt:
@cindex system prompt
@cindex prompt
@code{ ok} in interpret state, @code{ compiled} in compile state.

@item division rounding:
@cindex division rounding
The ordinary division words @code{/ mod /mod */ */mod} perform floored
division (with the default installation of Gforth).  You can check
this with @code{s" floored" environment? drop .}.  If you write
programs that need a specific division rounding, best use
@code{fm/mod} or @code{sm/rem} for portability.

@item values of @code{STATE} when true:
@cindex @code{STATE} values
-1.

@item values returned after arithmetic overflow:
On two's complement machines, arithmetic is performed modulo
2**bits-per-cell for single arithmetic and 4**bits-per-cell for double
arithmetic (with appropriate mapping for signed types). Division by
zero typically results in a @code{-55 throw} (Floating-point
unidentified fault) or @code{-10 throw} (divide by zero).  Integer
division overflow can result in these throws, or in @code{-11 throw};
in @code{gforth-fast} division overflow and divide by zero may also
result in returning bogus results without producing an exception.

@item whether the current definition can be found after @t{DOES>}:

@cindex undefined word
@code{-13 throw} (Undefined word).

@item a definition name exceeds the maximum length allowed:
@cindex word name too long
@code{-19 throw} (Word name too long)

@item addressing a region not inside the various data spaces of the forth system:
@cindex Invalid memory address
The stacks, code space and header space are accessible. Machine code space is
typically readable. Accessing other addresses gives results dependent on
the operating system. On decent systems: @code{-9 throw} (Invalid memory
address).

@item argument type incompatible with parameter:
@cindex argument type mismatch
This is usually not caught. Some words perform checks, e.g., the control
flow words, and issue a @code{ABORT"} or @code{-12 THROW} (Argument type
mismatch).

@item attempting to obtain the execution token of a word with undefined execution semantics:
@cindex compile-only warning, for @code{'} etc.
@cindex execution token of words with undefined execution semantics
The execution token represents the interpretation semantics of the
word.  Gforth defines interpretation semantics for all words; for
words where the standard does not define interpretation semantics, but
defines the execution semantics (except @code{LEAVE}), the
interpretation semantics are to perform the execution semantics.  For
words where the standard defines no interprtation semantics, but
defined compilation semantics (plus @code{LEAVE}), the interpretation
semantics are to perform the compilation semantics.  Some words are
marked as compile-only, and @code{'} gives a warning for these words.

@item dividing by zero:
@cindex dividing by zero
@cindex floating point unidentified fault, integer division
On some platforms, this produces a @code{-10 throw} (Division by
zero); on other systems, this typically results in a @code{-55 throw}
(Floating-point unidentified fault).

@item insufficient data stack or return stack space:
@cindex insufficient data stack or return stack space
@cindex stack overflow
@cindex address alignment exception, stack overflow
@cindex Invalid memory address, stack overflow
Depending on the operating system, the installation, and the invocation
of Gforth, this is either checked by the memory management hardware, or
it is not checked. If it is checked, you typically get a @code{-3 throw}
(Stack overflow), @code{-5 throw} (Return stack overflow), or @code{-9
throw} (Invalid memory address) (depending on the platform and how you
achieved the overflow) as soon as the overflow happens. If it is not
checked, overflows typically result in mysterious illegal memory
accesses, producing @code{-9 throw} (Invalid memory address) or
@code{-23 throw} (Address alignment exception); they might also destroy
the internal data structure of @code{ALLOCATE} and friends, resulting in
various errors in these words.

@item insufficient space for loop control parameters:
@cindex insufficient space for loop control parameters
Like other return stack overflows.

@item insufficient space in the dictionary:
@cindex insufficient space in the dictionary
@cindex dictionary overflow
If you try to allot (either directly with @code{allot}, or indirectly
with @code{,}, @code{create} etc.) more memory than available in the
dictionary, you get a @code{-8 throw} (Dictionary overflow). If you try
to access memory beyond the end of the dictionary, the results are
similar to stack overflows.

@item interpreting a word with undefined interpretation semantics:
@cindex interpreting a word with undefined interpretation semantics
@cindex Interpreting a compile-only word
Gforth defines interpretation semantics for all words; for words where
the standard defines execution semantics (except @code{LEAVE}), the
interpretation semantics are to perform the execution semantics.  For
words where the standard defines no interprtation semantics, but
defined compilation semantics (plus @code{LEAVE}), the interpretation
semantics are to perform the compilation semantics.  Some words are
marked as compile-only, and text-interpreting them gives a warning.

@item modifying the contents of the input buffer or a string literal:
@cindex modifying the contents of the input buffer or a string literal
These are located in writable memory and can be modified.

@item overflow of the pictured numeric output string:
@cindex overflow of the pictured numeric output string
@cindex pictured numeric output string, overflow
@code{-17 throw} (Pictured numeric output string overflow).

@item parsed string overflow:
@cindex parsed string overflow
@code{PARSE} cannot overflow. @code{WORD} does not check for overflow.

@item producing a result out of range:
@cindex result out of range
On two's complement machines, arithmetic is performed modulo
2**bits-per-cell for single arithmetic and 4**bits-per-cell for double
arithmetic (with appropriate mapping for signed types). Division by
zero typically results in a @code{-10 throw} (divide by zero) or
@code{-55 throw} (floating point unidentified fault). Overflow on
division may result in these errors or in @code{-11 throw} (result out
of range).  @code{Gforth-fast} may silently produce bogus results on
division overflow or division by zero.  @code{Convert} and
@code{>number} currently overflow silently.

@item reading from an empty data or return stack:
@cindex stack empty
@cindex stack underflow
@cindex return stack underflow
The data stack is checked by the outer (aka text) interpreter after
every word executed. If it has underflowed, a @code{-4 throw} (Stack
underflow) is performed. Apart from that, stacks may be checked or not,
depending on operating system, installation, and invocation. If they are
caught by a check, they typically result in @code{-4 throw} (Stack
underflow), @code{-6 throw} (Return stack underflow) or @code{-9 throw}
(Invalid memory address), depending on the platform and which stack
underflows and by how much. Note that even if the system uses checking
(through the MMU), your program may have to underflow by a significant
number of stack items to trigger the reaction (the reason for this is
that the MMU, and therefore the checking, works with a page-size
granularity).  If there is no checking, the symptoms resulting from an
underflow are similar to those from an overflow.  Unbalanced return
stack errors can result in a variety of symptoms, including @code{-9 throw}
(Invalid memory address) and Illegal Instruction (typically @code{-260
throw}).

@item unexpected end of the input buffer, resulting in an attempt to use a zero-length string as a name:
@cindex unexpected end of the input buffer
@cindex zero-length string as a name
@cindex Attempt to use zero-length string as a name
@code{Create} and its descendants perform a @code{-16 throw} (Attempt to
use zero-length string as a name). Words like @code{'} probably will not
find what they search. Note that it is possible to create zero-length
names with @code{nextname} (should it not?).

@item @code{>IN} greater than input buffer:
@cindex @code{>IN} greater than input buffer
The next invocation of a parsing word returns a string with length 0.

@item @code{RECURSE} appears after @code{DOES>}:
@cindex @code{RECURSE} appears after @code{DOES>}
Compiles a recursive call to the code after @code{DOES>}.

@item argument input source different than current input source for @code{RESTORE-INPUT}:
@cindex argument input source different than current input source for @code{RESTORE-INPUT}
@cindex argument type mismatch, @code{RESTORE-INPUT}
@cindex @code{RESTORE-INPUT}, Argument type mismatch
@code{-12 THROW}. Note that, once an input file is closed (e.g., because
the end of the file was reached), its source-id may be
reused. Therefore, restoring an input source specification referencing a
closed file may lead to unpredictable results instead of a @code{-12
THROW}.

In the future, Gforth may be able to restore input source specifications
from other than the current input source.

@item data space containing definitions gets de-allocated:
@cindex data space containing definitions gets de-allocated
Deallocation with @code{allot} is not checked. This typically results in
memory access faults or execution of illegal instructions.

@item data space read/write with incorrect alignment:
@cindex data space read/write with incorrect alignment
@cindex alignment faults
@cindex address alignment exception
Processor-dependent. Typically results in a @code{-23 throw} (Address
alignment exception). Under Linux-Intel on a 486 or later processor with
alignment turned on, incorrect alignment results in a @code{-9 throw}
(Invalid memory address). There are reportedly some processors with
alignment restrictions that do not report violations.

@item data space pointer not properly aligned, @code{,}, @code{C,}:
@cindex data space pointer not properly aligned, @code{,}, @code{C,}
Like other alignment errors.

@item less than u+2 stack items (@code{PICK} and @code{ROLL}):

@item String longer than a counted string returned by @code{WORD}:
@cindex string longer than a counted string returned by @code{WORD}
@cindex @code{WORD}, string overflow
Not checked. The string will be ok, but the count will, of course,
contain only the least significant bits of the length.

@item u greater than or equal to the number of bits in a cell (@code{LSHIFT}, @code{RSHIFT}):
@cindex @code{LSHIFT}, large shift counts
@cindex @code{RSHIFT}, large shift counts
Processor-dependent. Typical behaviours are returning 0 and using only
the low bits of the shift count.

@item word not defined via @code{CREATE}:
@cindex @code{>BODY} of non-@code{CREATE}d words
@code{>BODY} produces the PFA of the word no matter how it was defined.

@cindex @code{DOES>} of non-@code{CREATE}d words
@code{DOES>} changes the execution semantics of the last defined word no
matter how it was defined. E.g., @code{CONSTANT DOES>} is equivalent to
@code{CREATE , DOES>}.

@item words improperly used outside @code{<#} and @code{#>}:
Not checked. As usual, you can expect memory faults.

@code{R/O}, @code{R/W} and @code{BIN} work as you would
expect. @code{W/O} translates into the C file opening mode @code{w} (or
@code{wb}): The file is cleared, if it exists, and created, if it does
not (with both @code{open-file} and @code{create-file}).  Under Unix
@code{create-file} creates a file with 666 permissions modified by your

@item file exceptions:
@cindex file exceptions
The file words do not raise exceptions (except, perhaps, memory access
faults when you pass illegal addresses or file-ids).

@item file line terminator:

@item file name format:
@cindex file name format
System dependent. Gforth just uses the file name format of your OS.

@item information returned by @code{FILE-STATUS}:
@cindex @code{FILE-STATUS}, returned information
@code{FILE-STATUS} returns the most powerful file access mode allowed
for the file: Either @code{R/O}, @code{W/O} or @code{R/W}. If the file
cannot be accessed, @code{R/O BIN} is returned. @code{BIN} is applicable
along with the returned mode.

@item @i{ior} values and meaning:
@cindex @i{ior} values and meaning
@cindex @i{wior} values and meaning
The @i{ior}s returned by the file and memory allocation words are

@chapter Should I use Gforth extensions?
@cindex Gforth extensions

As you read through the rest of this manual, you will see documentation
for @i{Standard} words, and documentation for some appealing Gforth
@i{extensions}. You might ask yourself the question: @i{``Should I
restrict myself to the standard, or should I use the extensions?''}

The answer depends on the goals you have for the program you are working
on:

@itemize @bullet

@item Is it just for yourself or do you want to share it with others?

@item
If you want to share it, do the others all use Gforth?

@item
If it is just for yourself, do you want to restrict yourself to Gforth?

@end itemize

If restricting the program to Gforth is ok, then there is no reason not
to use extensions.  It is still a good idea to keep to the standard
where it is easy, in case you want to reuse these parts in another
program that you want to be portable.

If you want to be able to port the program to other Forth systems, there
are the following points to consider:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Most Forth systems that are being maintained support Standard Forth.
So if your program complies with the standard, it will be portable
among many systems.

@item
A number of the Gforth extensions can be implemented in Standard Forth using
public-domain files provided in the @file{compat/} directory. These are
mentioned in the text in passing.  There is no reason not to use these
extensions, your program will still be Standard Forth compliant; just include
the appropriate compat files with your program.

@item
The tool @file{ans-report.fs} (@pxref{Standard Report}) makes it easy to
analyse your program and determine what non-Standard words it relies
upon.  However, it does not check whether you use standard words in a
non-standard way.

@item
Some techniques are not standardized by Standard Forth, and are hard or
impossible to implement in a standard way, but can be implemented in
most Forth systems easily, and usually in similar ways (e.g., accessing
word headers).  Forth has a rich historical precedent for programmers
taking advantage of implementation-dependent features of their tools
(for example, relying on a knowledge of the dictionary
structure). Sometimes these techniques are necessary to extract every
last bit of performance from the hardware, sometimes they are just a
programming shorthand.

@item
Does using a Gforth extension save more work than the porting this part
to other Forth systems (if any) will cost?

@item
Is the additional functionality worth the reduction in portability and
the additional porting problems?

@end itemize

In order to perform these considerations, you need to know what's
standard and what's not.  This manual generally states if something is
non-standard, but the authoritative source is the
@uref{https://forth-standard.org/standard/words,standard document}.
Appendix A of the Standard (@var{Rationale}) provides a valuable insight
into the thought processes of the technical committee.

Note also that portability between Forth systems is not the only
portability issue; there is also the issue of portability between
different platforms (processor/OS combinations).

@chapter Integrating Gforth into C programs

Several people like to use Forth as scripting language for applications
that are otherwise written in C, C++, or some other language.

The Forth system ATLAST provides facilities for embedding it into
applications; unfortunately it has several disadvantages: most
importantly, it is not based on Standard Forth, and it is apparently dead
(i.e., not developed further and not supported). The facilities
provided by Gforth in this area are inspired by ATLAST's facilities, so
making the switch should not be hard.

We also tried to design the interface such that it can easily be
implemented by other Forth systems, so that we may one day arrive at a
standardized interface. Such a standard interface would allow you to
replace the Forth system without having to rewrite C code.

You embed the Gforth interpreter by linking with the library
@code{libgforth.a} or @code{libgforth.so} (give the compiler the
option @code{-lgforth}, or for one of the other engines
@code{-lgforth-fast}, @code{-lgforth-itc}, or @code{-lgforth-ditc}).
All global symbols in this library that belong to the interface, have
the prefix @code{gforth_}; if a common interface emerges, the
functions may also be available through @code{#define}s with the
prefix @code{forth_}.

You can include the declarations of Forth types, the functions and
variables of the interface with @code{#include <gforth.h>}.

You can now run a Gforth session by either calling @code{gforth_main}
or using the components:

@example
Cell gforth_main(int argc, char **argv, char **env)
@{
  Cell retvalue=gforth_start(argc, argv);

  if(retvalue == -56) @{ /* throw-code for quit */
    retvalue = gforth_bootmessage();     // show boot message
    if(retvalue == -56)
      retvalue = gforth_quit(); // run quit loop
  @}
  gforth_cleanup();
  gforth_printmetrics();
  // gforth_free_dict(); // if you want to restart, do this

  return retvalue;
@}
@end example

To interact with the Forth interpreter, there's @code{Xt
gforth_find(Char * name)} and @code{Cell gforth_execute(Xt xt)}.

More documentation needs to be put here.

@section Types

@code{Cell}, @code{UCell}: data stack elements.

@code{Float}: float stack element.

@code{Address}, @code{Xt}, @code{Label}: pointer typies to memory,
Forth words, and Forth instructions inside the VM.

@section Variables

Data and FP Stack pointer. Area sizes. Accessing the Stacks

@code{gforth_SP}, @code{gforth_FP}.

@section Functions

@example
void *gforth_engine(Xt *, stackpointers *);
Cell gforth_main(int argc, char **argv, char **env);
int gforth_args(int argc, char **argv, char **path, char **imagename);
ImageHeader* gforth_loader(char* imagename, char* path);
user_area* gforth_stacks(Cell dsize, Cell rsize, Cell fsize, Cell lsize);
void gforth_free_stacks(user_area* t);
void gforth_setstacks(user_area * t);
void gforth_free_dict();
Cell gforth_go(Xt* ip0);
Cell gforth_boot(int argc, char** argv, char* path);
void gforth_bootmessage();
Cell gforth_start(int argc, char ** argv);
Cell gforth_quit();
Xt gforth_find(Char * name);
Cell gforth_execute(Xt xt);
void gforth_cleanup();
void gforth_printmetrics();
void gforth_setwinch();
@end example

@section Signals

Gforth sets up signal handlers to catch exceptions and window size
changes.  This may interfere with your C program.

several tags files at the same time (e.g., one for the Gforth sources
and one for your program, @pxref{Select Tags Table,,Selecting a Tags

@file{$(datadir)/gforth/$(VERSION)/TAGS} (e.g.,
@file{/usr/local/share/gforth/0.2.0/TAGS}).  To get the best behaviour

@node Hilighting, Auto-Indentation, Emacs Tags, Emacs and Gforth
@section Hilighting
@cindex hilighting Forth code in Emacs
@cindex highlighting Forth code in Emacs
@file{gforth.el} comes with a custom source hilighting engine.  When
you open a file in @code{forth-mode}, it will be completely parsed,
assigning faces to keywords, comments, strings etc.  While you edit
the file, modified regions get parsed and updated on-the-fly. 

Use the variable `forth-hilight-level' to change the level of
decoration from 0 (no hilighting at all) to 3 (the default).  Even if
you set the hilighting level to 0, the parser will still work in the
background, collecting information about whether regions of text are
``compiled'' or ``interpreted''.  Those information are required for
auto-indentation to work properly.  Set `forth-disable-parser' to
non-nil if your computer is too slow to handle parsing.  This will
have an impact on the smartness of the auto-indentation engine,
though.

Sometimes Forth sources define new features that should be hilighted,
new control structures, defining-words etc.  You can use the variable
`forth-custom-words' to make @code{forth-mode} hilight additional
words and constructs.  See the docstring of `forth-words' for details
(in Emacs, type @kbd{C-h v forth-words}).

`forth-custom-words' is meant to be customized in your
@file{.emacs} file.  To customize hilighing in a file-specific manner,
set `forth-local-words' in a local-variables section at the end of
your source file (@pxref{Local Variables in Files,, Variables, emacs, Emacs Manual}).

Example:
@example
0 [IF]
   Local Variables:
   forth-local-words:
      ((("t:") definition-starter (font-lock-keyword-face . 1)
        "[ \t\n]" t name (font-lock-function-name-face . 3))

@code{forth-mode} automatically tries to indent lines in a smart way,
whenever you type @key{TAB} or break a line with @kbd{C-m}.

Simple customization can be achieved by setting
`forth-indent-level' and `forth-minor-indent-level' in your
@file{.emacs} file. For historical reasons @file{gforth.el} indents
per default by multiples of 4 columns.  To use the more traditional
3-column indentation, add the following lines to your @file{.emacs}:

@example
(add-hook 'forth-mode-hook (function (lambda ()
   ;; customize variables here:
   (setq forth-indent-level 3)
   (setq forth-minor-indent-level 1)
)))
@end example

If you want indentation to recognize non-default words, customize it
by setting `forth-custom-indent-words' in your @file{.emacs}.  See the
docstring of `forth-indent-words' for details (in Emacs, type @kbd{C-h
v forth-indent-words}).

To customize indentation in a file-specific manner, set
`forth-local-indent-words' in a local-variables section at the end of
your source file (@pxref{Local Variables in Files, Variables,,emacs,
Emacs Manual}).

Example:
@example
0 [IF]
   Local Variables:
   forth-local-indent-words:

@code{forth-mode} Autodetects blocks files by checking whether the
length of the first line exceeds 1023 characters.  It then tries to
convert the file into normal text format.  When you save the file, it
will be written to disk as normal stream-source file.

If you want to write blocks files, use @code{forth-blocks-mode}.  It
inherits all the features from @code{forth-mode}, plus some additions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Files are written to disk in blocks file format.
@item
Screen numbers are displayed in the mode line (enumerated beginning
with the value of `forth-block-base')
@item
Warnings are displayed when lines exceed 64 characters.
@item

overlay-arrow. 
@end itemize

There are some restrictions you should be aware of.  When you open a
blocks file that contains tabulator or newline characters, these
characters will be translated into spaces when the file is written
back to disk.  If tabs or newlines are encountered during blocks file
reading, an error is output to the echo area. So have a look at the
`*Messages*' buffer, when Emacs' bell rings during reading.

An image created with @code{gforthmi} (@pxref{gforthmi}) or
@code{savesystem} (@pxref{Non-Relocatable Image Files}) includes the
original image; i.e., according to copyright law it is a derived work of
the original image.

Since Gforth is distributed under the GNU GPL, the newly created image
falls under the GNU GPL, too. In particular, this means that if you
distribute the image, you have to make all of the sources for the image
available, including those you wrote.  For details see @ref{Copying, ,
GNU General Public License (Section 3)}.

If you create an image with @code{cross} (@pxref{cross.fs}), the image
contains only code compiled from the sources you gave it; if none of
these sources is under the GPL, the terms discussed above do not apply
to the image. However, if your image needs an engine (a gforth binary)
that is under the GPL, you should make sure that you distribute both in
a way that is at most a @emph{mere aggregation}, if you don't want the
terms of the GPL to apply to the image.

@node Image File Background, Non-Relocatable Image Files, Image Licensing Issues, Image Files
@section Image File Background
@cindex image file background

Gforth consists not only of primitives (in the engine), but also of
definitions written in Forth. Since the Forth compiler itself belongs to
those definitions, it is not possible to start the system with the
engine and the Forth source alone. Therefore we provide the Forth
code as an image file in nearly executable form. When Gforth starts up,
a C routine loads the image file into memory, optionally relocates the
addresses, then sets up the memory (stacks etc.) according to
information in the image file, and (finally) starts executing Forth
code.

The default image file is @file{gforth.fi} (in the @code{GFORTHPATH}).
You can use a different image by using the @code{-i},
@code{--image-file} or @code{--appl-image} options (@pxref{Invoking
Gforth}), e.g.:

@example
gforth-fast -i myimage.fi
@end example

There are different variants of image files, and they represent
different compromises between the goals of making it easy to generate
image files and making them portable.

@cindex relocation at run-time
Win32Forth 3.4 and Mitch Bradley's @code{cforth} use relocation at
run-time. This avoids many of the complications discussed below (image
files are data relocatable without further ado), but costs performance
(one addition per memory access) and makes it difficult to pass
addresses between Forth and library calls or other programs.

@cindex relocation at load-time
By contrast, the Gforth loader performs relocation at image load time. The
loader also has to replace tokens that represent primitive calls with the
appropriate code-field addresses (or code addresses in the case of
direct threading).

There are three kinds of image files, with different degrees of
relocatability: non-relocatable, data-relocatable, and fully relocatable
image files.

@cindex image file loader
@cindex relocating loader
@cindex loader for image files
These image file variants have several restrictions in common; they are
caused by the design of the image file loader:

@itemize @bullet
@item
There is only one segment; in particular, this means, that an image file
cannot represent @code{ALLOCATE}d memory chunks (and pointers to
them). The contents of the stacks are not represented, either.

@item
The only kinds of relocation supported are: adding the same offset to
all cells that represent data addresses; and replacing special tokens
with code addresses or with pieces of machine code.

If any complex computations involving addresses are performed, the
results cannot be represented in the image file. Several applications that
use such computations come to mind:

@itemize @minus
@item
Hashing addresses (or data structures which contain addresses) for table
lookup. If you use Gforth's @code{table}s or @code{wordlist}s for this
purpose, you will have no problem, because the hash tables are
recomputed automatically when the system is started. If you use your own
hash tables, you will have to do something similar.

@item
There's a cute implementation of doubly-linked lists that uses
@code{XOR}ed addresses. You could represent such lists as singly-linked
in the image file, and restore the doubly-linked representation on
startup.@footnote{In my opinion, though, you should think thrice before
using a doubly-linked list (whatever implementation).}

@item
The code addresses of run-time routines like @code{docol:} cannot be
represented in the image file (because their tokens would be replaced by
machine code in direct threaded implementations). As a workaround,
compute these addresses at run-time with @code{>code-address} from the
executions tokens of appropriate words (see the definitions of
@code{docol:} and friends in @file{kernel/getdoers.fs}).

@item
On many architectures addresses are represented in machine code in some
shifted or mangled form. You cannot put @code{CODE} words that contain
absolute addresses in this form in a relocatable image file. Workarounds
are representing the address in some relative form (e.g., relative to
the CFA, which is present in some register), or loading the address from
a place where it is stored in a non-mangled form.

@node  Non-Relocatable Image Files, Data-Relocatable Image Files, Image File Background, Image Files
@section Non-Relocatable Image Files
@cindex non-relocatable image files
@cindex image file, non-relocatable

These files are simple memory dumps of the dictionary. They are
specific to the executable (i.e., @file{gforth} file) they were
created with. What's worse, they are specific to the place on which
the dictionary resided when the image was created. Now, there is no
guarantee that the dictionary will reside at the same place the next
time you start Gforth, so there's no guarantee that a non-relocatable
image will work the next time (Gforth will complain instead of
crashing, though).  Indeed, on OSs with (enabled) address-space
randomization non-relocatable images are unlikely to work.

You can create a non-relocatable image file with @code{savesystem}, e.g.:

@example
gforth app.fs -e "savesystem app.fi bye"
@end example

@node Data-Relocatable Image Files, Fully Relocatable Image Files, Non-Relocatable Image Files, Image Files
@section Data-Relocatable Image Files
@cindex data-relocatable image files
@cindex image file, data-relocatable

These files contain relocatable data addresses, but fixed code
addresses (instead of tokens). They are specific to the executable
(i.e., @file{gforth} file) they were created with.  Also, they disable
dynamic native code generation (typically a factor of 2 in speed).
You get a data-relocatable image, if you pass the engine you want to
use through the @code{GFORTHD} environment variable to @file{gforthmi}
(@pxref{gforthmi}), e.g.

@example
GFORTHD="/usr/bin/gforth-fast --no-dynamic" gforthmi myimage.fi source.fs
@end example

Note that the @code{--no-dynamic} is required here for the image to
work (otherwise it will contain references to dynamically generated
code that is not saved in the image).


@node Fully Relocatable Image Files, Stack and Dictionary Sizes, Data-Relocatable Image Files, Image Files
@section Fully Relocatable Image Files
@cindex fully relocatable image files
@cindex image file, fully relocatable

@cindex @file{kern*.fi}, relocatability
@cindex @file{gforth.fi}, relocatability
These image files have relocatable data addresses, and tokens for code
addresses. They can be used with different binaries (e.g., with and
without debugging) on the same machine, and even across machines with
the same data formats (byte order, cell size, floating point format),
and they work with dynamic native code generation.  However, they are
usually specific to the version of Gforth they were created with. The
files @file{gforth.fi} and @file{kernl*.fi} are fully relocatable.

There are two ways to create a fully relocatable image file:

@menu
* gforthmi::                    The normal way
* cross.fs::                    The hard way
@end menu

@node gforthmi, cross.fs, Fully Relocatable Image Files, Fully Relocatable Image Files
@subsection @file{gforthmi}
@cindex @file{comp-i.fs}
@cindex @file{gforthmi}

You will usually use @file{gforthmi}. If you want to create an
image @i{file} that contains everything you would load by invoking
Gforth with @code{gforth @i{options}}, you simply say:
@example
gforthmi @i{file} @i{options}
@end example

E.g., if you want to create an image @file{asm.fi} that has the file
@file{asm.fs} loaded in addition to the usual stuff, you could do it
like this:

@example
gforthmi asm.fi asm.fs
@end example

@file{gforthmi} is implemented as a sh script and works like this: It
produces two non-relocatable images for different addresses and then
compares them. Its output reflects this: first you see the output (if
any) of the two Gforth invocations that produce the non-relocatable image
files, then you see the output of the comparing program: It displays the
offset used for data addresses and the offset used for code addresses;
moreover, for each cell that cannot be represented correctly in the
image files, it displays a line like this:

@example
     78DC         BFFFFA50         BFFFFA40
@end example

This means that at offset $78dc from @code{forthstart}, one input image
contains $bffffa50, and the other contains $bffffa40. Since these cells
cannot be represented correctly in the output image, you should examine
these places in the dictionary and verify that these cells are dead
(i.e., not read before they are written).

@cindex --application, @code{gforthmi} option
If you insert the option @code{--application} in front of the image file
name, you will get an image that uses the @code{--appl-image} option
instead of the @code{--image-file} option (@pxref{Invoking
Gforth}). When you execute such an image on Unix (by typing the image
name as command), the Gforth engine will pass all options to the image
instead of trying to interpret them as engine options.

If you type @file{gforthmi} with no arguments, it prints some usage
instructions.

@cindex @code{savesystem} during @file{gforthmi}
@cindex @code{bye} during @file{gforthmi}
@cindex doubly indirect threaded code
@cindex environment variables
@cindex @code{GFORTHD} -- environment variable
@cindex @code{GFORTH} -- environment variable
@cindex @code{gforth-ditc}
There are a few wrinkles: After processing the passed @i{options}, the
words @code{savesystem} and @code{bye} must be visible. A special
doubly indirect threaded version of the @file{gforth} executable is
used for creating the non-relocatable images; you can pass the exact
filename of this executable through the environment variable
@code{GFORTHD} (default: @file{gforth-ditc}); if you pass a version
that is not doubly indirect threaded, you will not get a fully
relocatable image, but a data-relocatable image
(@pxref{Data-Relocatable Image Files}), because there is no code
address offset). The normal @file{gforth} executable is used for
creating the relocatable image; you can pass the exact filename of
this executable through the environment variable @code{GFORTH}.

@node cross.fs,  , gforthmi, Fully Relocatable Image Files
@subsection @file{cross.fs}
@cindex @file{cross.fs}
@cindex cross-compiler
@cindex metacompiler
@cindex target compiler

You can also use @code{cross}, a batch compiler that accepts a Forth-like
programming language (@pxref{Cross Compiler}).

@code{cross} allows you to create image files for machines with
different data sizes and data formats than the one used for generating
the image file. You can also use it to create an application image that
does not contain a Forth compiler. These features are bought with
restrictions and inconveniences in programming. E.g., addresses have to
be stored in memory with special words (@code{A!}, @code{A,}, etc.) in
order to make the code relocatable.


@node Stack and Dictionary Sizes, Running Image Files, Fully Relocatable Image Files, Image Files
@section Stack and Dictionary Sizes
@cindex image file, stack and dictionary sizes
@cindex dictionary size default
@cindex stack size default

If you invoke Gforth with a command line flag for the size
(@pxref{Invoking Gforth}), the size you specify is stored in the
dictionary. If you save the dictionary with @code{savesystem} or create
an image with @file{gforthmi}, this size will become the default
for the resulting image file. E.g., the following will create a
fully relocatable version of @file{gforth.fi} with a 1MB dictionary:

@example
gforthmi gforth.fi -m 1M
@end example

In other words, if you want to set the default size for the dictionary
and the stacks of an image, just invoke @file{gforthmi} with the
appropriate options when creating the image.

@cindex stack size, cache-friendly
Note: For cache-friendly behaviour (i.e., good performance), you should
make the sizes of the stacks modulo, say, 2K, somewhat different. E.g.,
the default stack sizes are: data: 16k (mod 2k=0); fp: 15.5k (mod
2k=1.5k); return: 15k(mod 2k=1k); locals: 14.5k (mod 2k=0.5k).

@node Running Image Files, Modifying the Startup Sequence, Stack and Dictionary Sizes, Image Files
@section Running Image Files
@cindex running image files
@cindex invoking image files
@cindex image file invocation

@cindex -i, invoke image file
@cindex --image file, invoke image file
You can invoke Gforth with an image file @i{image} instead of the
default @file{gforth.fi} with the @code{-i} flag (@pxref{Invoking Gforth}):
@example
gforth -i @i{image}
@end example

@cindex executable image file
@cindex image file, executable
If your operating system supports starting scripts with a line of the
form @code{#! ...}, you just have to type the image file name to start
Gforth with this image file (note that the file extension @code{.fi} is
just a convention). I.e., to run Gforth with the image file @i{image},
you can just type @i{image} instead of @code{gforth -i @i{image}}.
This works because every @code{.fi} file starts with a line of this
format:

@example
#! /usr/local/bin/gforth-0.4.0 -i
@end example

The file and pathname for the Gforth engine specified on this line is
the specific Gforth executable that it was built against; i.e. the value
of the environment variable @code{GFORTH} at the time that
@file{gforthmi} was executed.

You can make use of the same shell capability to make a Forth source
file into an executable. For example, if you place this text in a file:

@example
#! /usr/local/bin/gforth

." Hello, world" CR
bye
@end example

@noindent
and then make the file executable (chmod +x in Unix), you can run it
directly from the command line. The sequence @code{#!} is used in two
ways; firstly, it is recognised as a ``magic sequence'' by the operating
system@footnote{The Unix kernel actually recognises two types of files:
executable files and files of data, where the data is processed by an
interpreter that is specified on the ``interpreter line'' -- the first
line of the file, starting with the sequence #!. There may be a small
limit (e.g., 32) on the number of characters that may be specified on
the interpreter line.} secondly it is treated as a comment character by
Gforth. Because of the second usage, a space is required between
@code{#!} and the path to the executable (moreover, some Unixes
require the sequence @code{#! /}).

Most Unix systems (including Linux) support exactly one option after
the binary name.  If that is not enough, you can use the following
trick:

@example
#! /bin/sh
: ## ; 0 [if]
exec gforth -m 10M -d 1M $0 "$@@"
[then]
." Hello, world" cr
bye \ caution: this prevents (further) processing of "$@@"
@end example

First this script is interpreted as shell script, which treats the
first two lines as (mostly) comments, then performs the third line,
which invokes gforth with this script (@code{$0}) as parameter and its
parameters as additional parameters (@code{"$@@"}).  Then this script
is interpreted as Forth script, which first defines a colon definition
@code{##}, then ignores everything up to @code{[then]} and finally
processes the following Forth code.  You can also use

@example
#0 [if]
@end example

in the second line, but this works only in Gforth-0.7.0 and later.

The @file{gforthmi} approach is the fastest one, the shell-based one
is slowest (needs to start an additional shell).  An additional
advantage of the shell approach is that it is unnecessary to know
where the Gforth binary resides, as long as it is in the @code{$PATH}.

@node Modifying the Startup Sequence,  , Running Image Files, Image Files
@section Modifying the Startup Sequence
@cindex startup sequence for image file
@cindex image file initialization sequence
@cindex initialization sequence of image file

You can add your own initialization to the startup sequence of an image
through the deferred word @code{'cold}. @code{'cold} is invoked just
before the image-specific command line processing (i.e., loading files
and evaluating (@code{-e}) strings) starts.

A sequence for adding your initialization usually looks like this:

@example
:noname
    Defers 'cold \ do other initialization stuff (e.g., rehashing wordlists)
    ... \ your stuff
; IS 'cold
@end example

After @code{'cold}, Gforth processes the image options
(@pxref{Invoking Gforth}), and then it performs @code{bootmessage},
another deferred word.  This normally prints Gforth's startup message
and does nothing else.

@cindex turnkey image files
@cindex image file, turnkey applications
So, if you want to make a turnkey image (i.e., an image for an
application instead of an extended Forth system), you can do this in
several ways:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you want to do your interpretation of the OS command-line
arguments, hook into @code{'cold}.  In that case you probably also
want to build the image with @code{gforthmi --application}
(@pxref{gforthmi}) to keep the engine from processing OS command line
options.  You can then do your own command-line processing with
@code{next-arg} 

@item
If you want to have the normal Gforth processing of OS command-line
arguments, but specify your own command-line options, hook into
@code{process-option}.

@item
If you want to have more options in addition to the ones that come with
Gforth, define words into the @code{options} vocabulary.

@item
If you want to display your own boot message, hook into
@code{bootmessage}.

@end itemize

In either case, you probably do not want the word that you execute in
these hooks to exit normally, but use @code{bye} or @code{throw}.
Otherwise the Gforth startup process would continue and eventually
present the Forth command line to the user.

@section Portability
@cindex engine portability

An important goal of the Gforth Project is availability across a wide
range of personal machines. fig-Forth, and, to a lesser extent, F83,
achieved this goal by manually coding the engine in assembly language
for several then-popular processors. This approach is very
labor-intensive and the results are short-lived due to progress in
computer architecture.

@cindex C, using C for the engine
Others have avoided this problem by coding in C, e.g., Mitch Bradley
(cforth), Mikael Patel (TILE) and Dirk Zoller (pfe). This approach is
particularly popular for UNIX-based Forths due to the large variety of
architectures of UNIX machines. Unfortunately an implementation in C
does not mix well with the goals of efficiency and with using
traditional techniques: Indirect or direct threading cannot be expressed
in C, and switch threading, the fastest technique available in C, is
significantly slower. Another problem with C is that it is very
cumbersome to express double integer arithmetic.

@cindex GNU C for the engine
@cindex long long
Fortunately, there is a portable language that does not have these
limitations: GNU C, the version of C processed by the GNU C compiler
(@pxref{C Extensions, , Extensions to the C Language Family, gcc,
GNU C Manual}). Its labels as values feature (@pxref{Labels as Values, ,
Labels as Values, gcc, GNU C Manual}) makes direct and indirect
threading possible, its @code{long long} type (@pxref{Long Long, ,
Double-Word Integers, gcc, GNU C Manual}) corresponds to Forth's
double numbers on many systems.  GNU C is freely available on all
important (and many unimportant) UNIX machines, VMS, 80386s running
MS-DOS, the Amiga, and the Atari ST, so a Forth written in GNU C can run
on all these machines.

Writing in a portable language has the reputation of producing code that
is slower than assembly. For our Forth engine we repeatedly looked at
the code produced by the compiler and eliminated most compiler-induced
inefficiencies by appropriate changes in the source code.

@cindex explicit register declarations
@cindex --enable-force-reg, configuration flag
@cindex -DFORCE_REG
However, register allocation cannot be portably influenced by the
programmer, leading to some inefficiencies on register-starved
machines. We use explicit register declarations (@pxref{Explicit Reg
Vars, , Variables in Specified Registers, gcc, GNU C Manual}) to
improve the speed on some machines. They are turned on by using the
configuration flag @code{--enable-force-reg} (@code{gcc} switch
@code{-DFORCE_REG}). Unfortunately, this feature not only depends on the
machine, but also on the compiler version: On some machines some
compiler versions produce incorrect code when certain explicit register
declarations are used. So by default @code{-DFORCE_REG} is not used.

@node Threading, Primitives, Portability, Engine
@section Threading
@cindex inner interpreter implementation
@cindex threaded code implementation

@cindex labels as values
GNU C's labels as values extension (available since @code{gcc-2.0},
@pxref{Labels as Values, , Labels as Values, gcc, GNU C Manual})
makes it possible to take the address of @i{label} by writing
@code{&&@i{label}}.  This address can then be used in a statement like
@code{goto *@i{address}}. I.e., @code{goto *&&x} is the same as
@code{goto x}.

@cindex @code{NEXT}, indirect threaded
@cindex indirect threaded inner interpreter
@cindex inner interpreter, indirect threaded
With this feature an indirect threaded @code{NEXT} looks like:
@example
cfa = *ip++;
ca = *cfa;
goto *ca;
@end example
@cindex instruction pointer
For those unfamiliar with the names: @code{ip} is the Forth instruction
pointer; the @code{cfa} (code-field address) corresponds to Standard Forth's
execution token and points to the code field of the next word to be
executed; The @code{ca} (code address) fetched from there points to some
executable code, e.g., a primitive or the colon definition handler
@code{docol}.

@cindex @code{NEXT}, direct threaded
@cindex direct threaded inner interpreter
@cindex inner interpreter, direct threaded
Direct threading is even simpler:
@example
ca = *ip++;
goto *ca;
@end example

Of course we have packaged the whole thing neatly in macros called
@code{NEXT} and @code{NEXT1} (the part of @code{NEXT} after fetching the cfa).

@node Scheduling, Direct or Indirect Threaded?, Threading, Threading
@subsection Scheduling
@cindex inner interpreter optimization

There is a little complication: Pipelined and superscalar processors,
i.e., RISC and some modern CISC machines can process independent
instructions while waiting for the results of an instruction. The
compiler usually reorders (schedules) the instructions in a way that
achieves good usage of these delay slots. However, on our first tries
the compiler did not do well on scheduling primitives. E.g., for
@code{+} implemented as
@example
n=sp[0]+sp[1];
sp++;
sp[0]=n;
NEXT;
@end example
the @code{NEXT} comes strictly after the other code, i.e., there is
nearly no scheduling. After a little thought the problem becomes clear:
The compiler cannot know that @code{sp} and @code{ip} point to different
addresses (and the version of @code{gcc} we used would not know it even
if it was possible), so it could not move the load of the cfa above the
store to the TOS. Indeed the pointers could be the same, if code on or
very near the top of stack were executed. In the interest of speed we
chose to forbid this probably unused ``feature'' and helped the compiler
in scheduling: @code{NEXT} is divided into several parts:
@code{NEXT_P0}, @code{NEXT_P1} and @code{NEXT_P2}). @code{+} now looks
like:
@example
NEXT_P0;
n=sp[0]+sp[1];
sp++;
NEXT_P1;
sp[0]=n;
NEXT_P2;
@end example

There are various schemes that distribute the different operations of
NEXT between these parts in several ways; in general, different schemes
perform best on different processors.  We use a scheme for most
architectures that performs well for most processors of this
architecture; in the future we may switch to benchmarking and choosing
the scheme on installation time.


@node Direct or Indirect Threaded?, Dynamic Superinstructions, Scheduling, Threading
@subsection Direct or Indirect Threaded?
@cindex threading, direct or indirect?

Threaded forth code consists of references to primitives (simple machine
code routines like @code{+}) and to non-primitives (e.g., colon
definitions, variables, constants); for a specific class of
non-primitives (e.g., variables) there is one code routine (e.g.,
@code{dovar}), but each variable needs a separate reference to its data.

Traditionally Forth has been implemented as indirect threaded code,
because this allows to use only one cell to reference a non-primitive
(basically you point to the data, and find the code address there).

@cindex primitive-centric threaded code
However, threaded code in Gforth (since 0.6.0) uses two cells for
non-primitives, one for the code address, and one for the data address;
the data pointer is an immediate argument for the virtual machine
instruction represented by the code address.  We call this
@emph{primitive-centric} threaded code, because all code addresses point
to simple primitives.  E.g., for a variable, the code address is for
@code{lit} (also used for integer literals like @code{99}).

Primitive-centric threaded code allows us to use (faster) direct
threading as dispatch method, completely portably (direct threaded code
in Gforth before 0.6.0 required architecture-specific code).  It also
eliminates the performance problems related to I-cache consistency that
386 implementations have with direct threaded code, and allows
additional optimizations.

@cindex hybrid direct/indirect threaded code
There is a catch, however: the @var{xt} parameter of @code{execute} can
occupy only one cell, so how do we pass non-primitives with their code
@emph{and} data addresses to them?  Our answer is to use indirect
threaded dispatch for @code{execute} and other words that use a
single-cell xt.  So, normal threaded code in colon definitions uses
direct threading, and @code{execute} and similar words, which dispatch
to xts on the data stack, use indirect threaded code.  We call this
@emph{hybrid direct/indirect} threaded code.

@cindex engines, gforth vs.@: gforth-fast vs.@: gforth-itc
@cindex gforth engine
@cindex gforth-fast engine
The engines @command{gforth} and @command{gforth-fast} use hybrid
direct/indirect threaded code.  This means that with these engines you
cannot use @code{,} to compile an xt.  Instead, you have to use
@code{compile,}.

@cindex gforth-itc engine
If you want to compile xts with @code{,}, use @command{gforth-itc}.
This engine uses plain old indirect threaded code.  It still compiles in
a primitive-centric style, so you cannot use @code{compile,} instead of
@code{,} (e.g., for producing tables of xts with @code{] word1 word2
... [}).  If you want to do that, you have to use @command{gforth-itc}
and execute @code{' , is compile,}.  Your program can check if it is
running on a hybrid direct/indirect threaded engine or a pure indirect
threaded engine with @code{threading-method} (@pxref{Threading Words}).


@node Dynamic Superinstructions, DOES>, Direct or Indirect Threaded?, Threading
@subsection Dynamic Superinstructions
@cindex Dynamic superinstructions with replication
@cindex Superinstructions
@cindex Replication

The engines @command{gforth} and @command{gforth-fast} use another
optimization: Dynamic superinstructions with replication.  As an
example, consider the following colon definition:

@example
: squared ( n1 -- n2 )
  dup * ;
@end example

Gforth compiles this into the threaded code sequence

@example
dup
*
;s
@end example

Use @code{simple-see} (@pxref{Examining compiled code}) to see the
threaded code of a colon definition.

In normal direct threaded code there is a code address occupying one
cell for each of these primitives.  Each code address points to a
machine code routine, and the interpreter jumps to this machine code in
order to execute the primitive.  The routines for these three
primitives are (in @command{gforth-fast} on the 386):

@example
Code dup  
( $804B950 )  add     esi , # -4  \ $83 $C6 $FC 
( $804B953 )  add     ebx , # 4  \ $83 $C3 $4

With dynamic superinstructions and replication the compiler does not
just lay down the threaded code, but also copies the machine code
fragments, usually without the jump at the end.

@example
( $4057D27D )  add     esi , # -4  \ $83 $C6 $FC 
( $4057D280 )  add     ebx , # 4  \ $83 $C3 $4

( $4057D292 )  mov     eax , dword ptr [edi]  \ $8B $7 
( $4057D294 )  add     edi , # 4  \ $83 $C7 $4 
( $4057D297 )  lea     ebx , dword ptr 4 [eax]  \ $8D $58 $4 
( $4057D29A )  jmp     dword ptr FC [ebx]  \ $FF $63 $FC 
@end example

Only when a threaded-code control-flow change happens (e.g., in
@code{;s}), the jump is appended.  This optimization eliminates many of
these jumps and makes the rest much more predictable.  The speedup
depends on the processor and the application; on the Athlon and Pentium
III this optimization typically produces a speedup by a factor of 2.

The code addresses in the direct-threaded code are set to point to the
appropriate points in the copied machine code, in this example like
this:

@example
primitive  code address
   dup       $4057D27D
   *         $4057D286
   ;s        $4057D292
@end example

Thus there can be threaded-code jumps to any place in this piece of
code.  This also simplifies decompilation quite a bit.

@code{See-code} (@pxref{Examining compiled code}) shows the threaded
code intermingled with the native code of dynamic superinstructions.
These days some additional optimizations are applied for the
dynamically-generated native code, so the output of @code{see-code
squared} on @code{gforth-fast} on one particular AMD64 installation
looks like this:

@example
$7FB689C678C8 dup    1->2 
7FB68990C1B2:   mov     r15,r8
$7FB689C678D0 *    2->1 
7FB68990C1B5:   imul    r8,r15
$7FB689C678D8 ;s    1->1 
7FB68990C1B9:   mov     rbx,[r14]
7FB68990C1BC:   add     r14,$08
7FB68990C1C0:   mov     rax,[rbx]
7FB68990C1C3:   jmp     eax
@end example

@cindex --no-dynamic command-line option
@cindex --no-super command-line option
You can disable this optimization with @option{--no-dynamic}.  You can
use the copying without eliminating the jumps (i.e., dynamic
replication, but without superinstructions) with @option{--no-super};
this gives the branch prediction benefit alone; the effect on
performance depends on the CPU; on the Athlon and Pentium III the
speedup is a little less than for dynamic superinstructions with
replication.

@cindex patching threaded code
One use of these options is if you want to patch the threaded code.
With superinstructions, many of the dispatch jumps are eliminated, so
patching often has no effect.  These options preserve all the dispatch
jumps.

@cindex --dynamic command-line option
On some machines dynamic superinstructions are disabled by default,
because it is unsafe on these machines.  However, if you feel
adventurous, you can enable it with @option{--dynamic}.

@cindex @code{DOES>} implementation

@cindex @code{dodoes} routine
@cindex @code{DOES>}-code
One of the most complex parts of a Forth engine is @code{dodoes}, i.e.,
the chunk of code executed by every word defined by a
@code{CREATE}...@code{DOES>} pair; actually with primitive-centric code,
this is only needed if the xt of the word is @code{execute}d. The main
problem here is: How to find the Forth code to be executed, i.e. the
code after the @code{DOES>} (the @code{DOES>}-code)? There are two
solutions:

In fig-Forth the code field points directly to the @code{dodoes} and the
@code{DOES>}-code address is stored in the cell after the code address
(i.e. at @code{@i{CFA} cell+}). It may seem that this solution is
illegal in the Forth-79 and all later standards, because in fig-Forth
this address lies in the body (which is illegal in these
standards). However, by making the code field larger for all words this
solution becomes legal again.  We use this approach.  Leaving a cell
unused in most words is a bit wasteful, but on the machines we are
targeting this is hardly a problem.

@node Automatic Generation, TOS Optimization, Primitives, Primitives
@subsection Automatic Generation
@cindex primitives, automatic generation

@cindex @file{prims2x.fs}

Since the primitives are implemented in a portable language, there is no
longer any need to minimize the number of primitives. On the contrary,
having many primitives has an advantage: speed. In order to reduce the
number of errors in primitives and to make programming them easier, we
provide a tool, the primitive generator (@file{prims2x.fs} aka Vmgen,
@pxref{Top, Vmgen, Introduction, vmgen, Vmgen}), that automatically
generates most (and sometimes all) of the C code for a primitive from
the stack effect notation.  The source for a primitive has the following
form:

@cindex primitive source format
@format
@i{Forth-name}  ( @i{stack-effect} )        @i{category}    [@i{pronounc.}]
[@code{""}@i{glossary entry}@code{""}]
@i{C code}
[@code{:}
@i{Forth code}]
@end format

The items in brackets are optional. The category and glossary fields
are there for generating the documentation, the Forth code is there
for manual implementations on machines without GNU C. E.g., the source
for the primitive @code{+} is:
@example
+    ( n1 n2 -- n )   core    plus
n = n1+n2;
@end example

This looks like a specification, but in fact @code{n = n1+n2} is C
code. Our primitive generation tool extracts a lot of information from
the stack effect notations@footnote{We use a one-stack notation, even
though we have separate data and floating-point stacks; The separate
notation can be generated easily from the unified notation.}: The number
of items popped from and pushed on the stack, their type, and by what
name they are referred to in the C code. It then generates a C code
prelude and postlude for each primitive. The final C code for @code{+}
looks like this:

@example
I_plus: /* + ( n1 n2 -- n ) */  /* label, stack effect */
/*  */                          /* documentation */
NAME("+")                       /* debugging output (with -DDEBUG) */
@{
DEF_CA                          /* definition of variable ca (indirect threading) */
Cell n1;                        /* definitions of variables */
Cell n2;
Cell n;
NEXT_P0;                        /* NEXT part 0 */
n1 = (Cell) sp[1];              /* input */
n2 = (Cell) TOS;
sp += 1;                        /* stack adjustment */
@{
n = n1+n2;                      /* C code taken from the source */
@}
NEXT_P1;                        /* NEXT part 1 */
TOS = (Cell)n;                  /* output */
NEXT_P2;                        /* NEXT part 2 */
@}
@end example

This looks long and inefficient, but the GNU C compiler optimizes quite
well and produces optimal code for @code{+} on, e.g., the R3000 and the
HP RISC machines: Defining the @code{n}s does not produce any code, and
using them as intermediate storage also adds no cost.

There are also other optimizations that are not illustrated by this
example: assignments between simple variables are usually for free (copy
propagation). If one of the stack items is not used by the primitive
(e.g.  in @code{drop}), the compiler eliminates the load from the stack
(dead code elimination). On the other hand, there are some things that
the compiler does not do, therefore they are performed by
@file{prims2x.fs}: The compiler does not optimize code away that stores
a stack item to the place where it just came from (e.g., @code{over}).

While programming a primitive is usually easy, there are a few cases
where the programmer has to take the actions of the generator into
account, most notably @code{?dup}, but also words that do not (always)
fall through to @code{NEXT}.

For more information

@node TOS Optimization, Produced code, Automatic Generation, Primitives
@subsection TOS Optimization
@cindex TOS optimization for primitives
@cindex primitives, keeping the TOS in a register

An important optimization for stack machine emulators, e.g., Forth
engines, is keeping  one or more of the top stack items in
registers.  If a word has the stack effect @i{in1}...@i{inx} @code{--}
@i{out1}...@i{outy}, keeping the top @i{n} items in registers
@itemize @bullet
@item
is better than keeping @i{n-1} items, if @i{x>=n} and @i{y>=n},
due to fewer loads from and stores to the stack.
@item is slower than keeping @i{n-1} items, if @i{x<>y} and @i{x<n} and
@i{y<n}, due to additional moves between registers.
@end itemize

@cindex -DUSE_TOS
@cindex -DUSE_NO_TOS
In particular, keeping one item in a register is never a disadvantage,
if there are enough registers. Keeping two items in registers is a
disadvantage for frequent words like @code{?branch}, constants,
variables, literals and @code{i}. Therefore our generator only produces
code that keeps zero or one items in registers. The generated C code
covers both cases; the selection between these alternatives is made at
C-compile time using the switch @code{-DUSE_TOS}. @code{TOS} in the C
code for @code{+} is just a simple variable name in the one-item case,
otherwise it is a macro that expands into @code{sp[0]}. Note that the
GNU C compiler tries to keep simple variables like @code{TOS} in
registers, and it usually succeeds, if there are enough registers.

@cindex -DUSE_FTOS
@cindex -DUSE_NO_FTOS
The primitive generator performs the TOS optimization for the
floating-point stack, too (@code{-DUSE_FTOS}). For floating-point
operations the benefit of this optimization is even larger:
floating-point operations take quite long on most processors, but can be
performed in parallel with other operations as long as their results are
not used. If the FP-TOS is kept in a register, this works. If
it is kept on the stack, i.e., in memory, the store into memory has to
wait for the result of the floating-point operation, lengthening the
execution time of the primitive considerably.

The TOS optimization makes the automatic generation of primitives a
bit more complicated. Just replacing all occurrences of @code{sp[0]} by
@code{TOS} is not sufficient. There are some special cases to
consider:
@itemize @bullet
@item In the case of @code{dup ( w -- w w )} the generator must not
eliminate the store to the original location of the item on the stack,
if the TOS optimization is turned on.
@item Primitives with stack effects of the form @code{--}
@i{out1}...@i{outy} must store the TOS to the stack at the start.
Likewise, primitives with the stack effect @i{in1}...@i{inx} @code{--}
must load the TOS from the stack at the end. But for the null stack
effect @code{--} no stores or loads should be generated.

@section Performance
@cindex performance of some Forth interpreters
@cindex engine performance
@cindex benchmarking Forth systems
@cindex Gforth performance

On RISCs the Gforth engine is very close to optimal; i.e., it is usually
impossible to write a significantly faster threaded-code engine.

On register-starved machines like the 386 architecture processors
improvements are possible, because @code{gcc} does not utilize the
registers as well as a human, even with explicit register declarations;
e.g., Bernd Beuster wrote a Forth system fragment in assembly language
and hand-tuned it for the 486; this system is 1.19 times faster on the
Sieve benchmark on a 486DX2/66 than Gforth compiled with
@code{gcc-2.6.3} with @code{-DFORCE_REG}.  The situation has improved
with gcc-2.95 and gforth-0.4.9; now the most important virtual machine
registers fit in real registers (and we can even afford to use the TOS
optimization), resulting in a speedup of 1.14 on the sieve over the
earlier results.  And dynamic superinstructions provide another speedup
(but only around a factor 1.2 on the 486).

@cindex Win32Forth performance
@cindex NT Forth performance
@cindex eforth performance
@cindex ThisForth performance
@cindex PFE performance
@cindex TILE performance
The potential advantage of assembly language implementations is not
necessarily realized in complete Forth systems: We compared Gforth-0.5.9
(direct threaded, compiled with @code{gcc-2.95.1} and
@code{-DFORCE_REG}) with Win32Forth 1.2093 (newer versions are
reportedly much faster), LMI's NT Forth (Beta, May 1994) and Eforth
(with and without peephole (aka pinhole) optimization of the threaded
code); all these systems were written in assembly language. We also
compared Gforth with three systems written in C: PFE-0.9.14 (compiled
with @code{gcc-2.6.3} with the default configuration for Linux:
@code{-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DUSE_REGS -DUNROLL_NEXT}), ThisForth
Beta (compiled with @code{gcc-2.6.3 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer}; ThisForth
employs peephole optimization of the threaded code) and TILE (compiled
with @code{make opt}). We benchmarked Gforth, PFE, ThisForth and TILE on
a 486DX2/66 under Linux. Kenneth O'Heskin kindly provided the results
for Win32Forth and NT Forth on a 486DX2/66 with similar memory
performance under Windows NT. Marcel Hendrix ported Eforth to Linux,
then extended it to run the benchmarks, added the peephole optimizer,
ran the benchmarks and reported the results.

We used four small benchmarks: the ubiquitous Sieve; bubble-sorting and
matrix multiplication come from the Stanford integer benchmarks and have
been translated into Forth by Martin Fraeman; we used the versions
included in the TILE Forth package, but with bigger data set sizes; and
a recursive Fibonacci number computation for benchmarking calling
performance. The following table shows the time taken for the benchmarks
scaled by the time taken by Gforth (in other words, it shows the speedup
factor that Gforth achieved over the other systems).

@example
relative       Win32-    NT       eforth       This-      
time     Gforth Forth Forth eforth  +opt   PFE Forth  TILE
sieve      1.00  2.16  1.78   2.16  1.32  2.46  4.96 13.37
bubble     1.00  1.93  2.07   2.18  1.29  2.21        5.70
matmul     1.00  1.92  1.76   1.90  0.96  2.06        5.32
fib        1.00  2.32  2.03   1.86  1.31  2.64  4.55  6.54
@end example

You may be quite surprised by the good performance of Gforth when
compared with systems written in assembly language. One important reason
for the disappointing performance of these other systems is probably
that they are not written optimally for the 486 (e.g., they use the
@code{lods} instruction). In addition, Win32Forth uses a comfortable,
but costly method for relocating the Forth image: like @code{cforth}, it
computes the actual addresses at run time, resulting in two address
computations per @code{NEXT} (@pxref{Image File Background}).

The speedup of Gforth over PFE, ThisForth and TILE can be easily
explained with the self-imposed restriction of the latter systems to
standard C, which makes efficient threading impossible (however, the
measured implementation of PFE uses a GNU C extension: @pxref{Global Reg
Vars, , Defining Global Register Variables, gcc, GNU C Manual}).
Moreover, current C compilers have a hard time optimizing other aspects
of the ThisForth and the TILE source.

The performance of Gforth on 386 architecture processors varies widely
with the version of @code{gcc} used. E.g., @code{gcc-2.5.8} failed to
allocate any of the virtual machine registers into real machine
registers by itself and would not work correctly with explicit register
declarations, giving a significantly slower engine (on a 486DX2/66
running the Sieve) than the one measured above.

Note that there have been several releases of Win32Forth since the
release presented here, so the results presented above may have little
predictive value for the performance of Win32Forth today (results for
the current release on an i486DX2/66 are welcome).

@cindex metacompiler
@cindex target compiler

The cross compiler is used to bootstrap a Forth kernel. Since Gforth is
mostly written in Forth, including crucial parts like the outer
interpreter and compiler, it needs compiled Forth code to get
started. The cross compiler allows to create new images for other
architectures, even running under another Forth system.

@node Using the Cross Compiler, How the Cross Compiler Works, Cross Compiler, Cross Compiler
@section Using the Cross Compiler

The cross compiler uses a language that resembles Forth, but isn't. The
main difference is that you can execute Forth code after definition,
while you usually can't execute the code compiled by cross, because the
code you are compiling is typically for a different computer than the
one you are compiling on.

@c anton: This chapter is somewhat different from what I would expect: I
@c would expect an explanation of the cross language and how to create an
@c application image with it.  The section explains some aspects of
@c creating a Gforth kernel.

The Makefile is already set up to allow you to create kernels for new
architectures with a simple make command. The generic kernels using the
GCC compiled virtual machine are created in the normal build process
with @code{make}. To create a embedded Gforth executable for e.g. the
8086 processor (running on a DOS machine), type

@example
make kernl-8086.fi
@end example

This will use the machine description from the @file{arch/8086}
directory to create a new kernel. A machine file may look like that:

@example
\ Parameter for target systems                         06oct92py

    4 Constant cell             \ cell size in bytes
    2 Constant cell<<           \ cell shift to bytes
    5 Constant cell>bit         \ cell shift to bits
    8 Constant bits/char        \ bits per character
    8 Constant bits/byte        \ bits per byte [default: 8]
    8 Constant float            \ bytes per float
    8 Constant /maxalign        \ maximum alignment in bytes
false Constant bigendian        \ byte order
( true=big, false=little )

include machpc.fs               \ feature list
@end example

This part is obligatory for the cross compiler itself, the feature list
is used by the kernel to conditionally compile some features in and out,
depending on whether the target supports these features.

There are some optional features, if you define your own primitives,
have an assembler, or need special, nonstandard preparation to make the
boot process work. @code{asm-include} includes an assembler,
@code{prims-include} includes primitives, and @code{>boot} prepares for
booting.

@example
: asm-include    ." Include assembler" cr
  s" arch/8086/asm.fs" included ;

: prims-include  ." Include primitives" cr
  s" arch/8086/prim.fs" included ;

: >boot          ." Prepare booting" cr
  s" ' boot >body into-forth 1+ !" evaluate ;
@end example

These words are used as sort of macro during the cross compilation in
the file @file{kernel/main.fs}. Instead of using these macros, it would
be possible --- but more complicated --- to write a new kernel project
file, too.

@file{kernel/main.fs} expects the machine description file name on the
stack; the cross compiler itself (@file{cross.fs}) assumes that either
@code{mach-file} leaves a counted string on the stack, or
@code{machine-file} leaves an address, count pair of the filename on the
stack.

The feature list is typically controlled using @code{SetValue}, generic
files that are used by several projects can use @code{DefaultValue}
instead. Both functions work like @code{Value}, when the value isn't
defined, but @code{SetValue} works like @code{to} if the value is
defined, and @code{DefaultValue} doesn't set anything, if the value is
defined.

@example

@section MINOS2 tutorial

Tutorials are small files, each showing a bit of MINOS2.  For the common
framework, the file @file{minos2/tutorial/tutorial.fs} needs to be
loaded first; all other tutorials in the command line argument are
included from within that file.  Scroll wheel or previous/next mouse
buttons as well as clicking on the left or right edge of the window
allow navigation between the different tutorials loaded.

I.e. to load the buttons tutorial, you start Gforth with

@example
gforth minos2/tutorial/tutorial.fs buttons.fs
@end example

Available tutorials:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{buttons.fs}: Clickable buttons

@item
@file{plots.fs}: Plot functions

@item
@file{markdown.fs}: Markdown document viewer

@item
@file{screenshot.fs}: Screenshot function

@section Authors and Contributors
@cindex authors of Gforth
@cindex contributors to Gforth

The Gforth project was started in mid-1992 by Bernd Paysan and Anton
Ertl. The third major author was Jens Wilke.  Neal Crook contributed a
lot to the manual.  Assemblers and disassemblers were contributed by
Andrew McKewan, Christian Pirker, Bernd Thallner, and Michal Revucky.
Lennart Benschop (who was one of Gforth's first users, in mid-1993)
and Stuart Ramsden inspired us with their continuous feedback. Lennart
Benshop contributed @file{glosgen.fs}, while Stuart Ramsden has been
working on automatic support for calling C libraries. Helpful comments
also came from Paul Kleinrubatscher, Christian Pirker, Dirk Zoller,
Marcel Hendrix, John Wavrik, Barrie Stott, Marc de Groot, Jorge
Acerada, Bruce Hoyt, Robert Epprecht, Dennis Ruffer and David
N. Williams. Since the release of Gforth-0.2.1 there were also helpful
comments from many others; thank you all, sorry for not listing you
here (but digging through my mailbox to extract your names is on my
to-do list).

Gforth also owes a lot to the authors of the tools we used (GCC, CVS,
and autoconf, among others), and to the creators of the Internet: Gforth
was developed across the Internet, and its authors did not meet
physically for the first 4 years of development.

@section Pedigree
@cindex pedigree of Gforth

Gforth descends from bigFORTH (1993) and fig-Forth.  Of course, a
significant part of the design of Gforth was prescribed by Standard Forth.

Bernd Paysan wrote bigFORTH, a descendent from TurboForth, an unreleased
32 bit native code version of VolksForth for the Atari ST, written
mostly by Dietrich Weineck.

VolksForth was written by Klaus Schleisiek, Bernd Pennemann, Georg
Rehfeld and Dietrich Weineck for the C64 (called UltraForth there) in
the mid-80s and ported to the Atari ST in 1986.  It descends from fig-Forth.

@c Henry Laxen and Mike Perry wrote F83 as a model implementation of the
@c Forth-83 standard. !! Pedigree? When?

A team led by Bill Ragsdale implemented fig-Forth on many processors in
1979. Robert Selzer and Bill Ragsdale developed the original
implementation of fig-Forth for the 6502 based on microForth.

The principal architect of microForth was Dean Sanderson. microForth was
FORTH, Inc.'s first off-the-shelf product. It was developed in 1976 for
the 1802, and subsequently implemented on the 8080, the 6800 and the
Z80.

All earlier Forth systems were custom-made, usually by Charles Moore,
who discovered (as he puts it) Forth during the late 60s. The first full
Forth existed in 1971.

A part of the information in this section comes from
@cite{@uref{https://www.forth.com/resources/evolution/index.html,The
Evolution of Forth}} by Elizabeth D. Rather, Donald R. Colburn and
Charles H. Moore, presented at the HOPL-II conference and preprinted
in SIGPLAN Notices 28(3), 1993.  You can find more historical and
genealogical information about Forth there.  For a more general (and
graphical) Forth family tree look see

Forth Family Tree and Timeline}.

@c anton: I threw most of this stuff out, because it can be found through
@c the FAQ and the FAQ is more likely to be up-to-date.

@cindex comp.lang.forth
@cindex frequently asked questions
There is an active news group (comp.lang.forth) discussing Forth
(including Gforth) and Forth-related issues. Its
@uref{https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/faq/faq-general-2.html,FAQs}
(frequently asked questions and their answers) contains a lot of
information on Forth.  You should read it before posting to
comp.lang.forth.

The Forth standard is most usable in its
