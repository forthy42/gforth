\ WARNING: This file is processed by m4. Make sure your identifiers
\ don't collide with m4's (e.g. by undefining them).
\ 
\ 
\ 
\ This file contains primitive specifications in the following format:
\ 
\ forth name	( stack effect )	category	[pronunciation]
\ [""glossary entry""]
\ C code
\ [:
\ Forth code]
\ 
\ Note: Fields in brackets are optional.  Word specifications have to
\ be separated by at least one empty line
\
\ Both pronounciation and stack items (in the stack effect) must
\ conform to the C identifier syntax or the C compiler will complain.
\ If you don't have a pronounciation field, the Forth name is used,
\ and has to conform to the C identifier syntax.
\ 
\ These specifications are automatically translated into C-code for the
\ interpreter and into some other files. I hope that your C compiler has
\ decent optimization, otherwise the automatically generated code will
\ be somewhat slow. The Forth version of the code is included for manual
\ compilers, so they will need to compile only the important words.
\ 
\ Note that stack pointer adjustment is performed according to stack
\ effect by automatically generated code and NEXT is automatically
\ appended to the C code. Also, you can use the names in the stack
\ effect in the C code. Stack access is automatic. One exception: if
\ your code does not fall through, the results are not stored into the
\ stack. Use different names on both sides of the '--', if you change a
\ value (some stores to the stack are optimized away).
\
\ For superinstructions the syntax is:
\
\ forth-name [/ c-name] = forth-name forth-name ...
\
\ 
\ The stack variables have the following types:
\ 
\ name matches	type
\ f.*		Bool
\ c.*		Char
\ [nw].*	Cell
\ u.*		UCell
\ d.*		DCell
\ ud.*		UDCell
\ r.*		Float
\ a_.*		Cell *
\ c_.*		Char *
\ f_.*		Float *
\ df_.*		DFloat *
\ sf_.*		SFloat *
\ xt.*		XT
\ f83name.*	F83Name *

\E set-current
\E store-optimization on
\E ' noop tail-nextp2 ! \ now INST_TAIL just stores, but does not jump
\E
\E include-skipped-insts on \ static superinsts include cells for components
\E                          \ useful for dynamic programming and
\E                          \ superinsts across entry points

\ 
\ 
\ 
\ In addition the following names can be used:
\ ip	the instruction pointer
\ sp	the data stack pointer
\ rp	the parameter stack pointer
\ lp	the locals stack pointer
\ NEXT	executes NEXT
\ cfa	
\ NEXT1	executes NEXT1
\ FLAG(x)	makes a Forth flag from a C flag
\ 
\ 
\ 
\ Percentages in comments are from Koopmans book: average/maximum use
\ (taken from four, not very representative benchmarks)
\ 
\ 
\ 
\ To do:
\ 
\ throw execute, cfa and NEXT1 out?
\ macroize *ip, ip++, *ip++ (pipelining)?
